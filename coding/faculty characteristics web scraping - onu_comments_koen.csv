209,45312408,weaknesses,"This course was very poorly executed. 1.) The course followed the flipped classroom methodology, but why? The entire course from day one was set up so that the responsibility of getting and digesting the material was placed squarely on the student (The flipped classroom methodology) and class time was only used for review of what the student should have taught themselves (in some cases in relatively shallow detail relative the level presented in the chapter or needed for the HW) and reviewing the homework if there were specific questions that someone had. I'm unsure why this approach was taken as it put a lot of work on the student to get and digest the information in addition to doing the immense amount of homework assigned almost every class (More on this in another section). To be frank, if I was interested in the topic of logic, I could have purchased the textbook and worked through it in my spare time and gotten an equivalent if not better education than I did by taking this course (As this was essentially all the course was), with the added benefit of getting to choose the amount of work I did or was needed to understand a given topic. 2.) Far too much homework In total, we were assigned 1,179 required problems for homework throughout the course, which correlates to an average of 84.21 problems per week (excluding weeks 9 and 14 which were midterms and break respectively), where the max assigned in a single week was 159 problems. This workload is further compounded by the fact that the chapter readings were assigned to be done by the student before each class in addition to all quizzes being done outside of class (To his credit, when the problems per week are graphed, a decline can be noticed in correlation to when quizzes are assigned). It is my understanding that the professor was approached by several students saying that the workload was a little intense and asking for him to consider reducing it, to which he said that he would. The workload was never reduced. I understand that mastery requires practice, but at what point does practice become beating a dead horse? The defense will be that if there were a lot of questions then they were short, but how this is simply not the case, and even if it were, there is still a non-trivial amount of time associated with doing them in addition to the other responsibilities of the class. 3.) Poor use of class time This was touched on some in the previous sections but class time ideally should have been used to lecture over the material that was expected to be learned by the student in enough depth that the homework was doable (rather than relying on the student to essentially teach it to themselves) and for quizzes (If they're take-home, homework should have been paused) and exams (Ideally would have fit into 1 class period but not overly problematic that they didn't). These problems ultimately lead to not reading the chapters in depth like I had in the beginning and only skimming them to answer specific questions, trying to get the homework done as quickly as possible as I viewed it as a chore once I got past the point of feeling like it was sufficient to learn the material (typically happened in 7 to 12 questions), and not being overly motivated to go to class (typically only 4 or 5 people regularly showed up to class out of a class of 9 or so) as I felt that I wouldn't gain much from the shallow coverage of the material that would be offered after doing the 20-50 questions of homework or that I should instead use that time to get caught up on homework I had fallen behind on.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

The problem comes where the homework wants you to correctly identify if a situation is ethical or not. Many times, the wrong answer was stated due to the lack of definitiveness. I also dislike the way the professor stated directions. They were unclear in many ways, using very flamboyant language that alienated me from the material. These words also had specific definitions within the context of the situation. As a result, it was very hard to get to where the professor wanted. It also must be mentioned that the professor expects you to immediately think like an ethics major or professor. There is no correction in how you are thinking and how you get to the conclusion, he only cares about the correct answer. An example of this can be seen when one student was thinking about the level of giving different treatment, where the professor wanted the idea of going to a different professional. Instead of stating that the different part was correct, or stating that the student was too specific, the professor just said that the answer is not it.

The outcomes of this course were confused to say the least. At many times it felt like a refresher of research methods. That in itself is not an entirely bad thing as a refresher of the skills discussed are useful for the purposes of writing a thesis. However, the application of these lessons felt lacking. Aside from being asked to submit work for our thesis we never really had the opportunity to work on them. The class felt that we were supposed to just absorb what we were being told and tact it onto our thesis. This left the class feeling more like research methods than an actual introduction to thesis writing. For those of us (most of the class) who already took reserach methods we really did not gain anything. Another weakness was the class was structured far more as a research methods class rather than a thesis. It felt that theory areas (often important for political science) were largely ignored in favor of purely quantitative work. It felt as though little attention was given to the wider design tools of a thesis.

1874,34132569,weaknesses,"I have three things: 1) Professor likes to make connections with other topics, which is lovely, but I think he assumes legal educations are more standardized than they are in practice. For example, one time he was trying to connect with a Civil Procedure principle that we were taught as _domicile,_ but he was looking for a different word (I don't remember much), so it looked like we just didn't know. Also, sometimes you forget things and then relearn them for the bar, and that's okay. I think the connection is good, but the expectations involved could be more flexible. 2) I really appreciate that Professor Baez tries to foster discussion, but I think sometimes he gets dissapointed if we don't come up with a bunch of different answers (like, recently we've been covering amortization and like-kind exchanges with number answers, and he'll want to put a bunch of numbers on the board, but we only come up with 2 or 3, and one of them is typically right, so I think he doesn't need to push so hard to get a diversity of answers. Although, teaching a class without a lot of response from students is also difficult). 3) Also, Professor Baez sometimes makes a mistake that I feel like is common with well-organized professors who rely on lots of class back-and-forth: Sometimes he's looking for an answer, and so he doesn't hear the student's whole answer, or quite register what they said. So, like, if he's looking for an answer but wants to talk about it one step at a time, but a student gives the full answer right away, he might latch on to the part he was looking for or recognizes first, and ask the student the next part. The student then assumes that part of what they said was wrong and has to search for another answer, and it feels awkward.

Now, time outside of class can and should be used if one doesn't have enough in-class time, but directions from the instructor are helpful. For example, with the CAD programs, there were instructor-lead classes, where he would, step-by-step, walk through using the programs. That was not the case, however, in learning Arduino, which, in my opinion, is a much more difficult skill, and would've benefited greatly from a few instructor-lead classes. It's this inconsistency which was often frustrating. One topic, I'm understanding wholly, while the next, being taught in an entirely different fashion, I feel left in the dust.

Also, I think that the practice problems we do should have the answer keys available online so we can verify that we are doing the processes correct instead of guessing. I think having quizzes would be useful also as this would allow the professor to check our progress with how we are doing on the practice problems. The professor also had handwriting that was difficult to read at some points, so either having typed notes that are projected on the board or slowing down to take the time to write a little neater would be useful so there is less confusion about what is being stated. There was also a point on the wastewater treatment cycle were we were given conflicting information, so verifying the information given is the correct one would be great so there is less room for confusion. Also, while the site visits were a good thing, I believe that being tested over them wasn't. It was hard to hear some of the people who were talking about the plant, especially if you were in the back of the group, and if they didn't go in the order of the plant, it was confusing.
