1,4.5,4.0,0,0,Awesome if challenging professor!
2,4.5,2.0,0,0,Awesome professor. Studied at some University called Cambridge? He adds like 20 points onto everyones quizzes and as long as you read the book  theyre easy. If you like history then take this class
3,1.0,5.0,1,0,This class is WAY too difficult for a GEC. I don't know what he expects and he is not clear AT ALL when giving lectures. The notes he gives online are also not very good. I would not recommend taking this course with this particular professor unless you already have a good background of Western Europe.
4,1.5,4.0,1,0,"Quizzes are unbelievably hard. A LOT of reliance on the book. (You have to read like 100 pages a week) Quizzes don't pertain to lecture. Exams are easier, one essay based on lecture and a few short answer questions. He's not very clear and has an EXTRAVAGANT vocabulary that is hard to understand. This class is TOO hard to be a GEC."
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,He is incredibly intelligent and international studies 210 was the epitome of a liberal arts education.
6,3.0,5.0,1,0,His exams are very difficult; for a GEC this class is WAY too hard.
7,2.5,5.0,0,0,"Thinks he's above students, boring, lets his TA do the work, the paper and exams were tough and harshly graded. I go out of my way to not take his classes. On the positive side he knows his stuff."
8,3.0,5.0,0,0,"This class was way too hard for a GEC 210 level class.  Don't take it! I didn't trust the other comments that warned not to take it and had to learn the hard way that this class sucks.  He is a great professor, full of information, but he gives you no direction on what you need to look over.  I went to every lecture and was still completely lost."
9,4.5,4.0,0,0,There is a lot of information. I had 50 written pages of notes for each of the midterm and final. There is also a final paper. The grading scale was nice
10,3.5,5.0,0,0,"far too in-depth for a 200 level class. The readings were long, not discussed, and not chronologically relevant to the day's lecture. The man is brilliant, but he expects you to be also in how he constructs his test questions. Tons of material overall. Avoid."
11,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Prof. Gunther is an expert on modern democracies (particularly regarding southern Europe), and his enthusiasm for the subject made his class very fun.  I learned a lot about modern democracies."
12,3.5,5.0,0,0,"Juggernaut of information to absorb, even with the online Study Guides.  Brilliant man.  Go to every class, sit in front, record his lecture, and listen to them while munching on some chips.  And go to the operas and orchestras for 6% extra credit."
13,4.5,3.0,0,0,"His energy of strong interest in the subject matter is highly contagious. Relates themes well to real world change. Taking notes is a strong requirement for success on the quizzes and exams, the latter having above average difficulty. Solid Five Star Recommend."
14,3.5,5.0,0,0,"Professor Gunther knows what he is talking about. Mostly all of his info was recited from memory, very passionate making him interesting to listen to. The class is difficult though. Pop quizzes are tough, Essay midterm wasn't bad. Prepare for tons of reading. Not an easy class."
15,4.5,3.0,0,0,"This man is unbelievably smart.  I've learned so much from him.  If you are looking for an easy A, try something else, but if you want to actually learn something, IS 210 is a great class."
16,4.5,3.0,0,0,A fantastic lecturer.  I now go out of my way to find what class he teaches so that I can schedule it.  My favorite professor at OSU.
17,5.0,2.0,0,0,"The level of knowledge Dr. Gunther has regarding democracies around the world is intimidating; nearly all of his statistics are recited from memory. What I assumed would be a dull class turned into one of my favorites, all due to Gunther. I'd take another class with him in a heartbeat."
18,4.5,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Gunther made what could of been a dull class fairly interesting. The tests were essay, but they were over lecture material and not very difficult. The reading is very dull, but it is not very essential for the tests. Long term paper."
19,4.5,2.0,0,0,"He's passionate and lecture isn't bad, but he goes off on tangents sometimes. Slides are poor and bare minimum.  Midterm and final were cake, but the quizzes are a bit difficult and worth 100 points!  A paper of five pages is only worth 10 points, though....?"
20,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Hard class (especially for an intro, 200-level class), I don't recommend it unless you're looking for a challenge. Prof is very smart but dry, and digresses a lot. Text readings are long and became unnecessary. 3 pop quizzes, a 5 page paper, midterm (mostly essay), & final (mostly essay). Honestly I'm just reallllly happy that this class is over."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,The most interesting class I've taken here at OSU. Dr. Krajbich consistently makes the content interesting and engaging. The course is stimulating and made me want to pursue this field in the future. Couldn't recommend this class more.
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,Great professor. Class was straight forward and homework graded based on effort. Exam short answers are based on homework problems. 
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,Great class. Great prof
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,There is a midterm and final exam each worth about 30-35% of your grade and then there are optional pop quizzes that you can opt-out of at the beginning of the semester (about 5%). the last 30% is based on problem sets that are based solely on completion. All in all the content in this class is very straightforward and this is a pretty easy A.
5,5.0,2.0,2,0,"Really interesting lectures, in a really interesting subject area. This class was mainly an overview of current research in the field. Dr. Krajbich does a great job of creating excitement for his subject within others, and he is sometimes pretty funny."
1,4.0,4.0,0,0,"I did not think I would like her or the class but I was wrong! Great class if you're interested in law or CJS. Straight forward lectures; clean, to the point slides and class almost always ends 15 min early. It takes work to get an A but its nothing unmanagable. Study guides cover everything on the exams! Exams: MC + ID terms and short answers."
2,2.0,4.0,2,1,"Course seemed basic enough at first, but I quickly realized how dry Prof. McGraw's was. The subject matter is fairly interesting, but lectures are stuffed and very boring. Exams are ridiculous, mostly multiple choice but they test the most insignificant details. And if you mess up, they're worth 35%, so good luck. First W, I say avoid at all costs."
3,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Midterm (35%), final (35%) (noncumulative) and paper (30%). Gives out very detailed study guides for the exams which have around 40 MC questions and 10-15 short answer. Paper is over a famous court trial in the 20th century. Material covered in class is very interesting. Focused on the criminal justice system. Put in the time in and get the grade. "
4,1.0,5.0,3,3,"I usually do not post any type of review or rating for professors. I, however, believed this to be an instance where such was imperative. In my correspondence with Prof. McGraw, she was rude, condescending, and unnecessarily degrading. He behavior was inexcusable and completely unprofessional, and therefore I do not recommend any of her courses."
5,4.0,3.0,1,0,Professor McGraw is a great lecturer. Her notes a clear and she tells you exactly what she is looking for. Plus class was usually only an hour long! She provides an overly detailed study guide.
6,4.5,4.0,0,1,"I really can't say enough about this professor. I found her to be very intelligent and engaging, and I found the course material to be relevant and applicable as a great intro to law. The reading is the lecture, and the lecture is very well structured. Attend the class. If you do the work in this class, you get the grade."
7,3.5,4.0,0,0,"Prof is very liberal and not afraid to tell you that. However she is a pretty good instructor, but her exams are kinda tough. She provides a study guide, but it is in about size 8 font, with 2 columns on each side of the page and packed full of EVERYTHING that was covered the whole time, so it really doesn't help you focus your studying much."
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,great professor got promoted to chair so wont be teaching for a while
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,I find it hard to believe that she didn't learn students names in the aformentioned class...because in my class of 60+ she knows a good deal of names (maybe you just have to participate.) Great prof...515 is a very interesting class.
10,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Assigns a lot of work, but exams and grading are very reasonable.  If you get to know her, you'll think she's fabulous."
11,2.0,1.0,0,0,"She makes no attempt to learn students' names or get to know them.  Her tests are extremely easy, but there's a long paper at the end (but she grades that easily, too.) She seemed to not enjoy teaching."
12,2.5,4.0,2,0,not very nice at all (i'm not bitter -- got a good grade but still).
13,5.0,3.0,0,1,Wonderful prof. One of the best at Ohio State!
1,5.0,1.0,0,0,"TAKE THIS CLASS as a freshman. It's an easy and interesting class with no tests, only short weekly writing assignments, and a group project. You get to learn from a really caring and intelligent professor who makes the class fun. He is very helpful and understanding with deadlines or missing class. He's the best professor I've had so far."
2,5.0,1.0,0,0,"If you are a freshman, TAKE THIS CLASS. It is not overwhelming at all. No final exam or final paper, so you have more time to study for finals for other classes. You have very short (around 200 words) writing assignments each week, and one presentation you do in a group in class. It was so easy, and let me get close to a great professor."
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,TAKE THIS CLASS: super interesting and great lectures. Some topics were more interesting than others but Abramowitz always made them enjoyable. He is a really cool guy and great teacher. The grade is based on 3 exams and 2 papers. The exams are fair if you take good notes. You can't miss any class though because he doesn't post the full slideshows.
4,5.0,1.0,0,0,Abramowitz is the best! So knowledgable about psychopathology. Lecture heavy but there's interesting videos and he's a great lecturer. Tests are 75% of your grade but all multiple choice and very straight forward. Easy A and great prof!
5,5.0,1.0,0,0,"If you need an easy A and don't mind attending lecture every class, TAKE ABNORMAL WITH ABRAMOWITZ. Seriously. Just do it."
6,4.0,1.0,2,0,"The best prof I've had so far. His class is 75% exams and 25% final essay, I was hesitant about that but the tests are extremely easy if you go to class and listen. He doesn't post full lectures so attendance is a must. Super nice guy and I really enjoyed his class even though I hate psych."
7,5.0,3.0,1,0,"Super chill professor. Nice, friendly, easily accessible. Willing to give feedback. Good lectures. Expects participation (part of your grade). Interesting lectures. Would definitely take this professor again."
8,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Abramowitz is awesome!! He is so passionate about psychology and really wants everyone to do well. As long as you go to class and take notes, you will do fine on the exams. There are just 3 non-cumulative exams and a paper on a movie about a psychological disorder. He is a great lecturer and very kind!!"
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,Very engaging and clearly cares about the success of his students! As long as you come to class and take good lecture notes you will be fine. Each test is 25% and 10 page final paper is also 25%
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Abramowitz is a super fun and interesting lecturer. I love that he helps illustrate concepts using stories from his own experience as a clinical psychologist. The class is very easy - the tests only have questions from the lectures, so reading the textbook is completely unneccesary. Besides the three tests, there is just one final paper."
11,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Seriously the best prof I've ever taken at UNC. He's very passionate about the material and his tests reflect the lectures well. The only ""complaint"" I have is that he doesn't post his full ppts online, so you have to go to class to get all the info. 75% of the grade is tests & 25% final essay, so take that for what you will. 10/10 would take again"
12,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Professor Abramowitz clearly loves what he does, and is extremely intelligent.  He enjoys discussion, and encourages it in his class.  Professor Abramowitz specializes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and it was extremely interesting to see the way he tied in his daily work to his class."
13,5.0,2.0,0,0,"One of the best professor's I have had. Extremely clear and helpful, and truly a nice guy. I learned a lot, and he really knows what he is talking about. Highly recommend."
14,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Abramowitz is one of the most interesting professors I've ever had ~ really witty and funny.  Learned a lot about abnormal psychology.  We did fun activities in class.  He wants you to do well (you have to study, though).  No regrets taking this class."
15,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Made abnormal psychology fun and interesting. He had great ""props"" and demonstrations to make classes very hands on."
1,5.0,3.0,1,0,"He is very caring and enjoys what he teaches. The course is dependent on a final 20-page term paper, with around 2 short assignments a week, and no exams/quizzes! Excellent choice for an Honors Seminar. Make sure to plan out getting the paper done, and you will be fine!"
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,Professor Aldrich is so wonderful! Thoroughly enjoyed this class and the class environment was very safe and inclusive. Class revolves around one large term paper which is manageable given that we spend all semester researching for it. No quizzes or exams. Professor Aldrich gives thoughtful feedback on assignments. Great option for honors seminar.
3,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Workload involves basic knowledge checks before class and the large cumulative term paper. The course reflects what you put in. If you are passionate and engage with Aldrich's material, you will breeze through. If not, you will find the class moderately difficult and boring. It's a very unique holistic approach to teaching at UNC, would recommend!"
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,the only bad part about this class is that you have to write a 15 page term paper but he breaks it up into smaller assignments as the semester goes on so it is manageable. the material is so interesting and he is great. really cares about his students success. he has past students who have done well come in and help you too. take him if you can!
5,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Aldrich is really caring when it comes to his students. If you're ever struggling, I recommend coming to officer hours or sending him an email. His grading is relatively fair as long as you show you understand Ritzer's four components of Rationalization (control, predictability, efficiency, & calculability). "
6,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Aldrich really cares about his students. Though his grading criteria is sometimes confusing (he is not always specific about what he wants, and online assignment descriptions don't usually match what he asks for in class), if you go to his office hours, he always helps you out. Kind of a lot of work for a first-year seminar, but doable for sure."
7,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Aldrich cares a lot about this class and his students. He gives good and very quick feedback. The subject matter is interesting but gets repetitive. Two short (two-page) papers, one medium (four-page) paper, and one long (fifteen-page) term paper. Lenient grader and offers support and good feedback. You don't ever want to disappoint him!"
8,4.0,3.0,0,0,Interesting course taught by a nice man who knows his stuff. Class is graded fairly leniently as it is a first-year seminar. He assigned a couple of fun projects throughout the semester.
9,5.0,3.0,2,0,Great professor! Really interested in the topic and wanted his students to learn. Course was composed of four short papers and a 15 page paper that you worked on throughout the semester. Very manageable as he provides great resources. Lots of group work and a final fun group project
10,4.0,3.0,0,0,"No tests, only papers. He does not grade hard."
11,5.0,3.0,1,0,super nice guy who really cares about his students
12,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Aldrich cares SO much about SOCI & students. Majority of grades are 4 short papers and one 15 page term paper, which is daunting but if you start early (or if you don't, it's manageable) He really wants to see students succeed. Utilize office hours even just to get to know him. Class itself is easy: groupwork, discussion, & activities/guests."
13,2.0,5.0,0,2,"This seminar is not for those looking for an easy A. There is so much writing in this class. There were four ""short"" papers and a massive 15 page paper at the end of the semester. He grades the short papers HARSHLY. Best comment on my paper, ""You seem to write things without thinking them through or caring."" Use his office hours for a better grade"
14,5.0,3.0,1,0,Professor Aldrich truly cares about his students! He is extremely accessible outside of class and welcomes student feedback.
15,3.0,3.0,0,0,"His first year seminar is graded on mostly papers, specifically a 15 page term paper, so be ready to write. Aldrich is a very interactive professor and cares about his students, but don't take this seminar if you're looking for an easy fys."
16,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Aldrich was awesome in terms of caring about his field of work, but this SOCI89H class became very redundant, very quickly. For people who are actually interested in full-scale rationalization of America, this class is for you! For me, I only enjoyed having Aldrich as a professor because he was helpful and intuitive, not due to the course"
17,4.0,3.0,2,1,"Professor Aldrich may come off as dry, but as the semester progresses it becomes apparent just how much he cares about the subject matter he is teaching. The final grade is comprised of  a few 2-page essays, participation, and discussion. Fairly easy class if you put forth the effort, and can be very interesting at times."
18,4.0,2.0,1,0,"Prof. Aldrich was great in my first-year seminar. He assigns a lot of short papers (2 - 5 pages, depending on the assignment) and grades pretty harshly, but if you use the sources he gives you, you should get a good grade. He cares about his students and gives monthly energy checks to make sure we're taking care of our mental health."
19,5.0,2.0,1,1,"He taught a great first year seminar on the ""McDonaldization of Society"".  He's passionate about teaching, sociology, and helping students understand the material."
20,3.5,1.0,0,0,"ok. not a hard grader and a decent teacher, but kind of a flake. relies heavily on jargon, ideology and intellectual trends."
1,4.0,3.0,0,0,Sara is really upbeat and does lots of demos in class.
1,3.0,3.0,0,0,"It is not difficult to get an A in this class if you put in the effort. I got a B+ because I didn't put in any effort into this class. If you do the all of the readings, it'll be easy. It's just a lot. Two papers, weekly quizzes, and recitation participation/attendance is a big part. She also uses UNC check-in for all lectures."
2,4.0,3.0,0,0,"It is not too difficult to get an A in this class.  The quizzes are hard, but the lowest 2 are dropped and the papers/exams are not bad.  There are 100+ pages of reading per week, but I didn't read any past spring brk and still got an A.  Manageable if you commit time.  Anderson is nice and tries to make lecture interesting.  Take Ranko as your TA!"
3,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Notot a ton of homework but there are two 5-7 page papers, a midterm, and a final. These assignments seem very difficult at face value but it is quite easy to get a good grade. Class felt a little formulaic but other then that it was good. It was my first and probably my only poli-sci class I will ever take. Subject material is a bit uninspired. "
4,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Anderson is an engaging lecturer and is passionate and knowledgeable about her subject. The attendance policy was generous, and so was the grading. Exam preparation was time consuming because there were so many terms to study and only four on the exam, but the exams themselves were manageable. Overall, I learned a lot and would recommend Anderson!"
5,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Multiple readings every week, but I never read them and ended with a B+. Tons of terms you need to know for exams because the exams are free responses, but I studied like a day before and did fine. TAs grade everything so your grade really just depends on if you get an easy one or not. Weekly quizzes, lowest two grades get dropped. Takes attendence"
6,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Solid class. Never did readings but studied hard for exams. Probably shouldve gotten an A, but got lazy on second paper. Exams are graded kinda weird but overall the grading was fair. Class made me consider poli sci as a major"
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I loved Professor Anderson's lectures. She is very knowledgable in the content and has a likeable personality. The class consisted of weekly online quizzes, two essays, a midterm, and a final. If you pay attention to her lectures and do the readings, you'll be fine. I would absolutely recommend taking a comparative politics class with her!"
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"very organized, and interesting lecture. easy to pay attention in class and many examples were given. there were a lot of readings but not super necessary. there were also weekly quizzes which boosted my grade"
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof Anderson herself is an engaging lecturer. Taught us the content via real-world examples. She is clearly so passionate about this subject, extremely intelligent, and funny. I want to be her friend. All grading done by TAs. Two 5-7 page papers, a midterm, a final. Exams were a few robust term definitions + an essay. Will do well if you study."
10,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Very cool, young, and relatable professor. Very knowledgable about what she teaches and explains it well. However, there are weekly quizzes that are very difficult and multiple essays. Lots of reading if you want an A."
11,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Lectures are amazing and informational, but with tons of information to sort through. There is also a crazy amount of reading, which you are expected to remember for the midterms and final. Papers are graded pretty harshly, and midterm is essentially all writing and identifying terms. Great class, but not an easy A. "
12,5.0,4.0,0,0,"The best lecturer I've had at UNC. Lectures are structured and connect the concepts of the class to real examples. Great intro to Polisci but is not an easy class. Lots of reading and keep up with notes. Midterm and final were very long and required you to know terms and authors, and papers were not graded easily."
13,4.0,3.0,0,0,"I never really talked to Professor Anderson one-on-one, but she was a very effective lecturer. The class is mainly guided by TA's so she is really just there to maintain the stability of the course. She is very intelligent and you will learn a lot in her class."
14,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Weekly quizzes, 2 papers, midterm, and final. Exams are both ID's (term definitions) and papers. Not hard at all if you put some effort in. Papers aren't bad either. TAs grade and were pretty easy. Quizzes were hard, but not big % of grade and 2 lowest were dropped. Prof was very knowledgable, interesting lectures and topics. Would recommend."
15,4.0,3.0,0,0,lots of readings for each week but you don't have to do them to pass the class. 2 papers and weekly quizzes which are not difficult and TA's don't grade papers harshly. Professor Anderson is very knowledgeable and this class was just interesting overall
16,5.0,4.0,0,0,"This class was both one of the most challenging I've taken and one of the most interesting. The lectures are super fast and the quizzes are tough, but the paper topics are interesting. The midterm and final were hard, but doable if you studied well. She is willing to make adjustments for students as needed. "
17,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Anderson is not very accessible to get help, but TA's do a good job. On the other hand, she is brilliant in this subject and knows what she is talking about. I would take this class, but be prepared to read a lot for every lecture. She records lectures but if attendance is low she will stop so show up to class."
18,4.0,4.0,0,0,"I found Professor Anderson's lectures to be engaging and easy to follow. I didn't love how she was not very accessible via email, and she took forever to grade course assignments (2 papers, group presentation, final podcast) and the midterm. Nonetheless, she is passionate about what she teaches and the class was very interesting."
19,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof Anderson is an amazing lecturer and the content is so interesting. The class is made up of two papers, easy online quizzes, a midterm, and a final. The midterm and final really aren't difficult and the class average on each one was around an 89, so very manageable. Your grade depends on your TA, but not terribly hard. Very fun class."
20,3.0,4.0,0,0,I personally really enjoyed the content of the class. The lectures were engaging and I could tell Dr. Anderson really knew her material. The midterm and the final were ridiculously hard. I enjoyed my TA and she was easy to contact. 
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,One of the best professors at UNC. There were some projects throughout the semester but had a lot of time to prepare for them. 
2,5.0,1.0,0,0,I had Professor Andrews for Soci-89 (a first year seminar) and really enjoyed the class. The material was very interesting and the way the class was run made me want to participate. The weekly assignments were easy but the readings could get long. There were 3 papers in the class that were manageable. 
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Andrews is hands down the best professor at UNC! I had him for Soci89, a first-year seminar but I recommend him for any class! There were weekly readings that could get pretty lengthy along with 3 essays (the longest was 6 pages). It was very easy to make an A because the readings/discussions were the main chunk of your grade. "
4,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Professor Andrews is a GREAT professor. This class was a seminar class, and it was a great learning environment. He is a caring person who cares greatly for his students and their thoughts. The class wasn't hard at all and was actually really engaging. I wouldn't just take this class, but I would take him as a professor for other courses as well!"
5,4.0,1.0,1,0,"2 papers + the final was also a paper, but most definitely not a harsh grader. It's pretty writing intensive w/ a 350-word reflection each week but the class is 100% discussion-based & an easy conversation! He just wants to hear your thoughts & if you participate even a little he really appreciates it. Content of the class is very interesting too"
6,4.5,1.0,1,0,"Prof. Andrews is one of the kindest professors at UNC. His lectures can be a little boring, but the class is pretty easy and I love him. You do a sort of case study on a social movement of your choosing and write a few papers throughout. They're easy to get an A though. I turned one in 4 hrs late and got a 95%. He's a great mentor, too"
7,5.0,5.0,0,2,Interesting.
8,4.0,2.0,0,0,Andy gets hotness points for his beard.
9,4.5,1.0,0,1,great prof.  he directed the seminar very well and the readings made the discussions very interesting.   he is also a great cook
1,3.0,5.0,0,0,"Not an easy A. This class is incredibly intensive and although she has high expectations for honors students, she's really accessible during office hours. She's passive-aggressive, and getting feedback from her outside of assignments is hard. Get ready to write a lot; many small and group assignments with a 10+ page research paper at the end. "
2,4.0,3.0,0,0,"This class was VERY boring. Dr. Arnold is fine, but she is definitely more of a research professor than a teaching professor. The last bit of this class was a research project, and she was very helpful with that. This class is not an easy A, but it isn't terribly hard. If you don't want to be bored and hate your FYS, don't take this class."
3,4.0,4.0,0,0,"I had extenuating circumstances this semester and would not have passed this class without Dr. Arnold's help. She cared about my success in her class and reached out often to make sure I stayed on top of the class. She grades intensely, but I do think her feedback is super helpful. She really showed tough love, which I deeply respect. "
4,1.0,4.0,0,0,"Do not take a class with her. Her grading standards are incredibly harsh and she gives very vague instructions for all assignments. She is very disorganized and has no idea how to use technology, she was not even able to post quizzes on Sakai without there being serious glitches. She is a researcher, not a teacher. "
5,1.0,4.0,0,0,I hate this class. 
6,1.0,4.0,0,0,"Class does not teach about language, it teaches about research. If I wanted to learn about research, I would have taken that class again. Lectures are super dry and she's completely unorganized, does class work out of order, and does not know how to communicate. -10/10 Do not recommend."
7,1.0,4.0,0,0,"Horrible lecturer. Doesn't teach or answer questions well. Course content is painfully dry. She's disorganized, constantly contradicting herself, and has no idea how to use technology. Assignment instructions are vague and confusing. She's an overall atrocious communicator and is so out of touch with her students. DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER!!!!!!"
8,1.0,4.0,0,0,"She is so dumb!! Absolutely no help in class, unreachable, extremely rude, her presence infuriates everyone. Makes you question her phd's cause she is not good in her field. Super disorganized. UNC has some questionable profs in general, but she doesn't deserve to be one here. Class is easy-but theres a lot of effort. She wouldn't round at the end."
9,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Nice but very intense and direct. Gives specific feedback on writing, doesn't grade lightly. Pays attention to every detail. Sometimes belabors points but generally has clear grading criteria. I am a little scared of her. She is very smart. You can't BS your way through writing. She will literally read all of it to make sure it makes sense."
10,2.0,5.0,0,0,"This class was a huge disappointment. Lots of readings and homework, rubrics, and criteria for assignments were incredibly vague. Also, she is a really tough grader for someone whose teaching skills are so average. Don't take this class."
11,4.0,3.0,0,0,Dr. Arnold is very passionate and knowledgable about the subject. Her criteria for each assignment was clear and she graded fairly. There was a research component to the class that was not only fun but also informative. Assigned readings and some lectures could be confusing but she was always quick to clarify anything people had questions about
12,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Just don't. I wish I would have taken a different upper level Psychology class. She is a very tough grader, yet not a great lecturer. Easy to conflict with her personality/style. Uses a bell curve for grades."
13,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Do not take this class, very boring and she grades very very tough. You will read about 60 pages every week and get a quiz on that before class starts every class."
14,3.0,5.0,0,0,"She is a good professor and really like the subject she is teaching. BUT She is a very very tough grader like she wants everything to be perfect. She gives research article summary assignments and expects you to use all of your words and nothing from the paper which makes no sense, because you have to talk about conditions and all. Not recommended."
15,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Professor Arnold is very invested in her class and subject material.  Sometimes her lectures are not the most interesting, but we did our own research and she helped a lot, making the course very worthwhile.  Easy A, not a heavy work load, just have to make sure you get your work done."
16,3.0,2.0,1,0,Dr. Arnold's PSYC 58 seminar is quite easy. A nice teacher but could be a boringbad lecturer.
17,5.0,2.0,0,0,"She was a good teacher. I had her for a FYS. It was my highest grade, and my easiest class my first semester of my first year. Great teacher! Nice lady! Cool class! Thumbs up."
18,4.5,3.0,1,1,"I loved this class! Her lectures were usually engaging, and I thought she did a good job of explaining the sometimes confusing concepts. Lots of tests = each test covered less material, each test not worth as much = better grades. Challenging yet interesting class - one of my favorites so far at UNC."
19,4.5,2.0,0,0,multiple choice part of test not as difficult as essay.  Tends to run out of time.  Will help you if you approach her.  Textbook v. boring
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I loved Poli 150 even as a Media and Journalism major! The class has few grades so study hard for the midterm and final! This was a super chill class that was really straightforward. I'd recommend it to anyone, I never did the lecture readings and still got an A- in the class. Also, both the TAs and the professor were accessible outside of class. "
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I've taken 2 classes with CBR, he's the best! 2 papers and 2 exams, is a fair grader, and is approachable. His study guides really prepare you for exams. His writing prompts are thought-provoking and something you can easily talk about if you've paid attention in class. "
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Ballard-Rosa was an excellent professor for an introductory IR and economics course. Despite his expertise in highly complicated domains, he prioritizes simple and straightforward explanations of course material. The course grade consisted of two papers, a midterm, a final, participation/attendance (within recitation)."
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Ballard-Rosa gave great lectures that made the course material digestible as well as engaging. I did get lucky with a great recitation leader as well, so my experience might be better than others. There are only 4 assignments total: 1 midterm, 2 essays, and the final. He posts all his lecture slides and Zoom recordings if you miss class."
5,4.0,3.0,0,0,"I found the lectures to be fairly engaging and even funny at some points. My only complaint is that there are only two assignments, outside of tests (a midterm and final), so you have to do really well on these to do well in the class. I would have personally preferred more smaller assignments through the semester."
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Ballard-Rosa is the best professor I have had at UNC. His lectures are incredibly engaging, often funny, and always interesting. I've taken him for poli 150, 442, and am taking him next semester for 440. He is a special professor. 100% take his course if you can. "
7,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Ballard-Rosa is incredible. He knows what he is talking about and really helps you understand the subject. I found his tests to be a bit unfair, not testing you on everything you know, however, the TA for my class was pretty awful, probably relating to the hard grading. His lectures are great and class is interesting, just get a good TA!!"
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Extremely skilled at lecturing, presents advanced ideas and research in very understandable terms. Would absolutely take again. Fair warning, the papers are complex."
9,3.0,2.0,1,0,"This was a good class overall. Only two assignments, a mid-term, and final. Only thing I wish was different was his lecture style because sometimes he would quickly cover more difficult topics and others were very repetitive."
10,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I LOVED this class. It was well structured, and Ballard-Rosa is a great presenter. The course had 2 major papers and 2 exams, but he was clear on all requirements. He was also very understanding with deadlines if negative events occurred on campus. Take a class with him."
11,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Ballard-Rosa is easily one of the best professors I have had at UNC. His lectures are incredibly relevant to the modern day and I learned an immense amount. He is constantly available outside of class and is extremely accommodating, no matter the situation. I would 100% recommend you take his upper level smaller classes (like 442)."
12,5.0,4.0,0,0,"CBR is a great prof for my upper lvl POLI class. There are much readings/dense and he gives AWESOME lectures and FEEDBACK on PS/Exams. He is funny and genuinely passionate about IPE and is vocal/ENGAGING. I will definitely take class with him! I did not do too good on my 1st PS, but could have got a A, so close. But massive respect to him! HARD PS!"
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,"CBR is a great professor. Although it is lecture heavy, he makes them really engaging. He is also very caring, and was very willing to work with students who were struggling. Your grade consists of 2 five page papers (Graded by TA), a mid-term, a final, and participation/attendance in recitations depending on your TA."
14,5.0,2.0,0,0,"CBR is a wonderful professor. It's a powerpoint lecture class, but that's to be expected with an entry poli sci course. Made the material interesting and humorous. Would not hesitate to take again."
15,5.0,2.0,0,0,"CBR is an excellent lecturer, and his lectures are thorough enough that you can go light on the readings. Although your grade is largely dependent on your TA, I felt the class was a pretty easy A. CBR's tests are straight forward and really not designed to trick you."
16,5.0,3.0,0,0,"CBR was amazing! He gives great lectures and explains concepts in a way that anyone can understand. There are only two graded assignments apart from the midterm and final, so it can be difficult to recover if you mess up on one. CBR makes understanding everything so easy and fun, though, that you won't have to worry. Would definitely recommend him!"
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,"CBR was awesome. Super caring and understanding of his students the whole semester. On top of that, he communicated the material really well and made the more mundane topics interesting. Only complaint is that there's only 2 papers and 2 tests, so if you slip up on one it's tricky to recover. Other than that, could not recommend this guy enough!"
18,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Honestly one of the best professors I've ever had. He's an Incredible and hilarious lecturer. He makes class enjoyable and the material easy to understand. Readings can be hard, but he explains everything in class, so it's okay even if you don't do them. Problem sets can be tricky, but he's super open to talking through them with you if you ask."
19,4.0,2.0,0,0,"He just loves teaching and is so good at it. However, his presentations were just reiterating the text book, so I stopped reading, but still getting an A or high B right now. 2 1500 word papers, midterm, final, and recitation attendance are all he grades."
20,5.0,3.0,0,0,CBR is one of the best lecturers I had here at UNC. I enjoyed how into the subject he was and how he was one of the only professors I had that cared for the mental wellbeing of all his students. Would 100 percent recommend to anyone who is considering a class of his
1,5.0,1.0,0,0,This professor is amazing. Available during office hours and genuinely cares about his students! He is an amazing professor and I would definitely take this class again!!!
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Awesome lectures with tons of info. Grade is based off of a few papers and online exams, so while this class requires a lot of reading, there is not too much pressure or time constraints. He also brings in amazing guest lecturers. "
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Bapat is amazing. Attendance isn't mandatory for lectures(although his lectures are really good! So would recommend going). There is a lot of reading, but I briefly skimmed it and a lot of times I didn't look at the book at all and I did really well in the class. Not too difficult if you put some effort into it! Loved this class."
4,4.0,2.0,0,0,Highly enjoyed this class and Prof. Bapat. He's a great lecturer and I learned so much from his class. It is not hard to do well if you do the work and put in effort for the few assignments. Highly recommend!
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Bapat was very organized and clear about what was expected. Our class had very few assignments so each was important, but the grading was not difficult. This class is very manageable and Professor Bapat was very personable and made the lectures interesting. "
6,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Professor Bapat was a great and very interesting lecturer. The class isn't hard if you go to class and put effort into your papers. He actually has a range of due dates for the essays, so don't wait until the end of the semester. Just make sure you attend recitation and do the reading for it. "
7,5.0,2.0,0,0,Prof Bapat is awesome! His lectures are super interesting and he clearly really cares about students. He is also super flexible.
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Bapat is the best professor I've had at UNC! He is very knowledgeable in the topic while making his lectures personable and engaging. The class consists of two essays, two midterms, and a final, all of which are open note and online. Getting an A in this class was very attainable and I also felt like I learned a lot from both Bapat and my TA."
9,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Bapat has been the best Political Science professor I have had at UNC. His 150 class is extremely easy while still being comprehensive. The course consists of 2 papers, 2 midterms, and a final, all of which are taken online at home. He is funny and has great stories, would recommend to anybody."
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,Professor Bapat is not only extremely knowledgeable about the material but he genuinely cares about his students. All lectures are posted online and tests are easy to study for because they come directly from the PowerPoint slides he makes. I actually learned quite a bit from this course and would highly recommend it.  
11,4.0,2.0,0,0,"such an easy class, lectures not mandatory and all slides were uploaded online just to copy"
12,3.0,2.0,0,0,"You can tell Prof Bapat is smart and intelligent. But his lectures are mostly timelines of political events. Studying requiring a lot of memorization, he also did not give much guidelines on the final research project. "
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,"PROFESSOR BAPAT IS AWESOME!! I can't stress it enough, he is amazing. Take his class"
14,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I loved Dr. Bapat! He really cares about the course, and he really wants students to think critically and learn. Dr. Bapat is great at explaining topics clearly, and the course followed a coherent path. I would absolutely take Dr. Bapat again."
15,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Bapat was very knowledgeable about the content of this class and an engaging lecturer. The class has 2, 5 page papers, 2 midterms, 1 final, and a recitation participation grade. Overall, I think Bapat gave a good introduction and foundation to international politics. "
16,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Bapat was awesome. He gave great lectures that were engaging and he was so clearly passionate about the subject that it was great to listen to. Attendance isn't required, but I would recommend bc the topic is so interesting. Graded off of 2 papers, participation, 2 midterms & a final, but the class is overall not hard. I would definitely take again"
17,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Bapat is a great lecturer and he really knows what he's talking about. He is passionate about everything he says and makes it super easy to follow. The class consists of 3 exams and two papers, not too bad. I would 100% recommend this class with Bapat."
18,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Best lecturer I have had so far at UNC. He really knows his stuff and his class is so well organized, there are no surprises. The class was SOO easy and he gives you plenty of time to get your stuff done. Exams are open note take home. I would take this class again in a heart beat. "
19,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Legit one of the best professors at Chapel Hill. For my class all we had were 2 exams, 2 papers, the midterm, and a weekly recitation (which was canceled half the time)."
20,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Grade consisted for two papers (you choose the papers you want to write/their due dates), three exams, and recitation.  Exams were open note, but do prepare for them.  Study lecture slides and readings (helpful for MC and essay section).  Had Parajon for TA.  Make sure you participate well and genuinely contribute to class. Fair essay grader."
1,5.0,4.0,0,0,Wowww such a great professor. Anna defenitely cares about her students and is interactive with everyone. I did not do that well in this class but I still recommend it 100%. I learned a lot and the information was very intriguing. The only thing is the exams are hard and there is not a lot of busy work so it is hard to bounce back from a low grade. 
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,"AMAZING! Dr. Bardone-Cone is so passionate about what she teaches which makes her lectures super interesting and engaging. She is also very nice and even baked cookies for everyone on LDOC :') This specific course was pretty easy with participation grades, a couple exams, and a 5-page course paper. I would highly recommend taking PSYC 245 with her!"
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Loved this class! All the assignments (except for exams and one paper) were basically completion grades - if you put in effort you made a 100%. All the assignments were easy and even the paper was only 5 pages. We had open book/out of class exams which made them doable but there is a lot of information, so closed book exams might be harder."
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Bardone-Cone was the best, she is so nice and knowledgeable about everything. This class was very interesting and easy definitely take if you can"
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Bardone-Cone made cookies for my entire lecture hall, a class of 200+ people. IDST 190 is a really easy and interesting class. Essentially if you show up to class and do the readings, you'll do fine in the class and learn a lot in it. 10/10 recommend Professor Bardone-Cone and IDST190"
6,4.0,3.0,0,0,"I enjoyed the Psychology section of this class. ABC was great and I met with her once outside of class and now she sends me articles relating to her research of eating disorders. It's important to know that TAs are the graders in this class, not the professors. I thought it was pretty standard with its courseload and I learned a good bit from her"
7,2.0,4.0,0,1,"Don't take this class. 2 Reading quizzes a week with only 10 min per quiz and so much reading it was impossible to find the answers in the time. Classes were divided between Law, Art History, and Psych. The only reason I gave this a 2 is because Psych was the best one. Have to write 6 Reading Journals, 3 Essays, and there is a Midterm and a Final."
8,3.0,3.0,0,0,This was a good class and she did a good job engaging the class with the material which was generally interesting which made it better. The only real negative was that grades had no description or rubric as to why points were deducted. Overall great teacher and solid FYS. I would encourage it if you're willing to show up.
9,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Anna is intelligent, energetic, and SO caring. Every class, her love for her work inspired me even more. She gives excellent feedback and is extremely helpful in every way. She really values students that speak up and share their thoughts in class! You will learn SO much from Anna. Her lectures are amazing, she is high-energy, funny, and inspiring"
10,4.5,2.0,0,0,She is awesome! Made the 8am class worth going to-very engaging. Loved the class and it was straightforward.
11,4.5,2.0,0,0,"This class is very interesting and easy to get an A! There are a few group projects that will take up some time. There is quite a bit of reading involved, but because I was interested in the material it was bearable. She is always there to help and is SO understanding. I liked this class so much that I decided to take another with her (PSYC 245)!"
12,5.0,2.0,2,0,She is a great teacher with high enthusiasm in the subject material. She posts lecture outlines and then neatly follows them in class. The subject isn't very difficult but the test can be tricky if you don't study the terms. Otherwise no homework and one paper.
1,1.0,4.0,0,0,"She uses a flipped teaching method which should've been my first red flag. IMO, flipped teaching is an excuse for lazy professors to not do their jobs and then when you come to them struggling, they can blame it on you for ""not doing the reading"". The topic is especially difficult, you're made to teach it to yourself, and she's rude. Save yourself."
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I took two classes with Professor Bassi and she is by far the best professor I have had at UNC. The game theory material is difficult but if you show up, pay attention, and engage, you will learn a lot and do well. She is so kind and cares about her students. Wish I could've taken more classes with her before I graduated."
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Bassi is amazing. Although tests do account for a significant portion of your grade, they are genuinely not difficult if you put effort into preparing for it. The assignments are made to be more difficult on purpose in order to better prepare you for the exam. Take a class with Professor Bassi, you will not regret it!"
4,1.0,3.0,0,0,"This class is mostly teach yourself at home. The lectures did not always align with the content on the midterms/assignments. The class is comprised of assignments, midterms, and a final. The midterms and final make up the bulk of the grade. The teacher is however understanding with grades and may weigh better grades more heavily. "
5,5.0,3.0,1,0,"This class is a mix, there are only 3 assignments and the final is 40%. The material is highly theoretical and sometimes counter intuitive, if you do not understand the concepts after the two weeks, drop it!! However, once you get over the learning curve it is a great class, do the extra practice and show up and you will be fine. 10/10 professor."
6,1.0,4.0,0,1,"This class was possibly the worst I have taken at UNC. Your grade consists of 3 homeworks and 3 tests, with the weight of the tests being much more than the homework. The lectures are literally pictures of the textbook that she talks about (with no mic) in front of the class for the entire period. If you take this class, choose a different prof."
7,4.0,3.0,1,0,"You have to practice a lot to do well since your grade is just three HWS and three tests. Really nice review videos, do the practice assignments and you'll be fine."
8,4.0,3.0,0,0,Very nice professor. Hws are really hard but if you watch her review videos and do practice problems an A is very attainable.
9,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Lectures are long and are not interactive in any way. Content is difficult to grasp and asking questions during class is not easy. There are few grades in the gradebook, so if you don't do well on all of them you're screwed."
10,1.0,4.0,1,0,"Entirely taught based on screenshots from the textbook. Discrepancies exist in teaching style between book and textbook however, making the course more confusing than it needs to be. Professor Bassi also spoke down to students, seemingly refused to answer question regarding homework and took access to the online lectures away days before the final."
11,5.0,3.0,0,0,"If you show up to lectures and pay attention you'll be well prepared. The extra practice problems are much closer to the actual exams than the assignments, so definitely do them. She's extremely nice if you have any questions and is consistently available through email and office hours."
12,5.0,4.0,1,1,"Professor Bassi is friendly, kind, understanding, and willing to meet outside of office hours for extra instruction or exam review. She's a fair grader and the tests aren't crazy hard if you study. Always do the extra practice problems (they're REALLY helpful! ) If you're willing to attend class and study, you'll do fine. If not, you won't pass."
13,1.0,4.0,1,0,"As others from this semester have previously stated, the professor struggled to clearly teach the material of the class. You would probably be better off researching the topics outside of class. The final exam was nothing like how the midterm had been, in terms of difficulty, and covered topics not taught in class. Definitely avoid."
14,1.0,5.0,1,0,Def skip this class. Concepts are explained vaguely - students explained them better. No resources are provided to help study; you don't even get your midterm back besides the grade. Final was unreasonably hard and had topics not covered in class. Prof was unwilling to do anything even though most students failed the final which is 40% of grade
15,1.0,4.0,1,0,"The professor poorly explained concepts (certain students did far better jobs explaining them), disregarded student concerns after their wifi cut out during exams, and gave a final that was shockingly more difficult than any of the assignments or midterm (average was 68, median was 65; 40% of grade). Most students had As until the final."
16,2.0,4.0,1,0,"Professor Bassi taught this class, POLI 288, for the first time online this semester. It was not great. The material was not explained very well through the both asynch and synch classes, and reviews of assignments were always asynch. I P/F'd this class due to this lack of understanding of the material. Not a great professor, difficult material."
17,2.0,1.0,1,0,"Went to class 4 times. First day, both exams, and to turn in an Extra Credit assignment. Got an A-. PowerPoints are online and the material is not difficult. Any amount of effort and you can get an A"
18,2.0,1.0,1,0,"Dr. Bassi is incredibly knowledgable about the subject. Unfortunately, this is one of the most boring classes I have ever taken. It moves a snail slow pace. Luckily, it's also very easy. Anyone with any game theory knowledge can likely show up to all the classes and get an A/B without much effort. Also, she is almost always late."
19,5.0,2.0,1,1,"Professor Bassi is just so accessible outside the class and she is not a tough grader at all. The material in the class is so fun if you are, like me, into game theory and voting system."
20,2.0,1.0,3,0,"Tests were extremely easy, curve is very generous. This class is an easy A. Prof. Bassi a lovely person but a poor instructor; she shows up 5-10 minutes late almost every day, she makes you sign up for a timeslot to go to her office hours, and she was absent pretty frequently (and sent the TA to teach the class). Easy class, poor instruction."
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Baucom is the best!! He truly cares about his students and does not grade difficultly. Only thing was that the class only had 4 assignments graded equally, but it was easy to get an A. "
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Baucom is an amazing professor! He is very caring and always strives to make his lectures as engaging as possible. He is very transparent which makes it easy for students to communicate with him. He truly wants you to learn and succeed in his class. The class is reading and somewhat lecture heavy, but it is so worth it! Would recommend!"
3,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Great prof, only downside is that he talks a ton so you'll have to watch videos after class often. Really did learn a lot, and this guy is wholesome. Chances are you'll like him too."
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Baucom was a great professor. Tests are straight-forward as long as you are paying attention in class and do all of the textbook reading. There was one term paper, but the topic was really interesting and Dr. Baucom provided great feedback."
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,Amazing professor! Lectures are super interesting and engaging. Tests are easy as long as you watch the videos and read the textbook (easy and fascinating readings). 10-page movie paper is easy and fun! Very accommodating during COVID. Grade is composed of the paper and 3 exams all weighted equally. No homework
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Baucom is awesome, intelligent, and cares about his students. I loved the class (abnormal psychology) and he was really accommodating through the pandemic. The final movie paper assignment was stressful but super interesting and he gave back great feedback! There are 3 exams and 1 paper (each worth 25% of the grade). Need to read the textbook"
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Baucom was a great professor. He made the content interesting, and he chose a good textbook to cover the content. You definitely should read the textbook since some parts of the exam are not covered in the lecture and only found in the reading. He was accommodating and engaging. The paper assigned is very interesting, based on films."
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,One of the loveliest human beings I know. Extremely knowledgeable and full of interesting anecdotes. The class is just exams and an essay -- no real homework. A fair and easy A if you try.
9,2.0,3.0,0,0,"I was excited to have a class with Baucom but this quickly turned into disappointment. Maybe had we had a normal semester this would not be so, but his lectures are pointless. also he is not accommodating AT ALL. everything has to be the way he says so, would not recommend him at all"
10,5.0,3.0,0,0,Dr. Baucom is easily the best professor I've ever had. He's brilliant in his field and he makes the information relatable and interesting. I actually looked forward to class each week. It's obvious he cares about his students and wants to engage with them. I wish he taught more undergraduate classes!
11,5.0,3.0,2,0,Absolutely fantastic professor. Interesting lectures full of real-world application/examples. Tests are very reasonable as long as you attend lectures and look through the book. Don't be put off by the 10 page paper - fascinating movie diagnosis project once you get into it. Only issue is he's not teaching every psych course.
12,5.0,3.0,1,0,"His lectures were super interesting and if you do have to miss class the powerpoints he teaches from are online. Reading the textbook helps if you want to do well in this class because there are 3 exams, including the final, worth 25% of your grade and a lot of the info comes from it. You do have to write a 10-page research paper (the other 25%)!"
13,5.0,3.0,2,0,"Dr. Baucom is amazing! He is a superstar in his field and totally cool. He loves to teach and I loved going to class and learning. The material is really interesting and he is a really fast grader who usually gets grades back the same day. 10/10 recommendation, not an easy A but attainable if you put in the work."
14,5.0,2.0,3,0,Was an astounding teacher. He was actively engaging and quite often had the class laughing or horribly embarrassed. He was personable when engaged one on one. Highly recommend taking him while at UNC.
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"He is very knowledgeable in quantitative psych and easy to talk to. It's not an easy A class, but he makes a dreary stats class enjoyable. Truly a gem in the department."
2,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Bauer ranks 1-2 standard deviations above the average instructor in kindness and understanding. Very easy to talk to. Virtual lectures sometimes were slow. Grades of 95 and above were A's. Generous but not very clear grading criteria. No final, just assignments, group project, and quizzes with like 5 questions (eek!)"
3,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Amazing prof, really made the material interesting. I ended up nominating him for a teaching award because of this class."
4,4.5,3.0,0,0,"very nice, helpful, and great to look at"
1,5.0,1.0,0,0,"This class was extraordinary!  Definitely one of the best classes to take at UNC!  Very eye-opening and inspiring.  Class was structured well.  Reading quizzes can be hit or miss, but they're open note and mostly easy.  Short essays were graded easily, and the final term paper was not bad.  Final exam was basically a mix of old reading quizzes."
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Your grade is composed of weekly quizzes, recitation attendance and participation, attendance at speaker series (unc brought wrongfully convicted speakers for our class to hear) 4 short essays that were basically easy 100's, a final exam that was just the weekly quiz questions and a 7 page final paper. Overall 10/10 class, everyone should take it"
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,I've loved my classes with Frank Baumgartner! He is super passionate about this class and cares more that we learn something rather than worrying about how to test us. Speaker series was interesting even though they were long and in the evening. His quizzes were exactly from the readings. TA grades papers and recitation attendance is mandatory.
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Best class I've taken so far. The material is very important and Prof. Baumgartner delivers it well -- he really knows what he's talking about. And even though the subject matter is dark, it's still a fun class bc of his personality. There is an AMAZING guest speaker series w/ wrongfully convicted people. Homework isn't bad. 100% recommend!"
5,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Really committed and passionate professor about the wrongs of the death penalty, but due to the structure of the large lecture, taught mostly by slides which was not engaging. Not a hard class, graded by lots of things, material isn't hard at all. "
6,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Fbaum became a sort of cult legend in our class. He's funny, knowledgable, and structured. Some of the ideological bent did come through during the semester and little time is spent on victims or crimes, but the class was largely fascinating statistics and interesting anecdotes. A great way to get your US and SS credits. TAKE IT."
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I was hesitant to take this class because I had no interest in poli sci, but this class is extremely interesting and illuminating about the death penalty in the US. It is one of the best classes you can take at Carolina. Baumgartner is an amazing professor as well. Take this! "
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,Fbaum is awesome! I love this class and am learning so much. This class is awesome and will be unforgettable. I think everyone should take this class. I would take any classes taught by Fbaum. You can't go wrong here!
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Life changing class and amazing professor. Important content that Frank makes very accessible to engage with, think about, and reflect. I recommend this class 1000% to any philosophy/political science major, or just any student in general who wants to dive into criminal justice."
10,5.0,3.0,0,0,Frank is the coolest guy ever. I have taken 2 of his classes and he is so awesome. I have really learned a lot from him.
11,5.0,2.0,0,0,"This was my second class with Dr. Baumgartner and he was great. Our class time was cut short due to unforeseen circumstances, but he was passionate about what he taught, knowledgeable, and understanding. He was always responsive to emails and questions. 10/10 would recommend taking a class with him if you get the chance!"
12,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Frank is amazing. He is so intelligent, gives assignments that are actually relevant, and is an awesome guy overall. I would take a class with him anytime again"
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I wasn't particularly impressed with his lectures but the speakers he invites make the class unforgettable. Having the opportunity to visit central prison and see death row for yourself is a life changing experience. The class itself isn't that difficult, but it is graded on only a few things and missing recitation or evening events will hurt you."
14,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof. Baumgartner's class on the death penalty was life-changing. I took his class a few years ago and I still talk about it all the time to anyone who will listen. POLI203 was far the most profound and interesting class I took at Carolina. While attendance was not mandatory, I never missed a class. Thank you, Prof. Baumgartner."
15,5.0,2.0,0,0,"This class is amazing. I came in not really having a clear stance on the death penalty, but left with tons of evidence steering me to one side. There are evening lectures, but the speakers are so interesting, plus the class is 4 credits (and a pretty easy A). Lectures are a bit boring at times, but not mandatory. Assignments aren't graded harshly."
16,5.0,3.0,0,0,"The lectures and speakers for this class were life changing. I will never look at criminal justice in the same way again. Not a super difficult class but truly inspirational. There is a lot of reading but Baumgartner really knows this topic, and the speakers he invites are incredible. Everyone should take Poli 203 its truly an amazing class!"
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Baumgartner is very passionate about what he teaches. His classes comprise of almost all lecture, but they are interesting. He more or less reads off the slides but they are posted online so not always necessary to attend class. Your grade depends mostly on the TA, but most are nice. Get ready to read and remember general trends."
18,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Frank is one of the best professors I have ever had at UNC. He is a fantastic teacher and just an overall great guy. This class itself was awesome. Attendance not mandatory but is so interesting you won't want to skip. The class is graded by TA's, but they aren't too difficult. I recommend everyone take this class, the speakers were amazing."
19,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof. Baumgartner is truly the best professor I've had at UNC. He is extremely knowledgable, witty, and genuinely cares about his students. Poli 203 with him was truly life-changing. We were graded on six 10-question quizzes, 2 papers, recitation, and final. Paper grades depend on your TA, though. Take any class you can with Baumgartner!!"
20,5.0,4.0,0,0,"The content and opportunities with this class are unmatched. Baumgartner is amazing and receptive to students, even with a 400 person lecture. I will say though that a lot of the information is number and small details, which you are expected to know for the final. Paper grading depends on TA."
1,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Bickford is an amazing educator and you will realize that if you engage and put in the effort like she asks you to. She is a tough grader but there are opportunities to improve your grade via ""tokens."" She stresses attendance and you won't do well if you are absent and don't do the readings. Readings are manageable and worth your time. "
2,5.0,4.0,1,0,"Ugh, love her! Very respectful towards students. The class is mostly a philosophy seminar (see: participation!) with lots of assigned readings & quite a bit of writing assignments. That being said, she is very flexible & considerate. The final was a self designed project so we got to be a bit creative and dive in deeper to what we wanted to learn."
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I took her POLI276H class and I will be taking as many of her classes as my schedule will allow. I love classes, but it does have a bit of reading. Amazing discussions, very respectful, and always able to talk. 10/10"
4,4.0,4.0,0,0,"If you don't have experience with political philosophy this class will not be easy. Dr. Bickford is a tough grader, but she gives a lot of feedback. She is a very kind and approachable person and is genuinely passionate about teaching."
5,1.0,3.0,0,0,"Embodies everything I used to hate about English classes in HS, encourages individual interpretation but says your interpretation is wrong. Only gives decent grades to those that think like her. Lowest paper grade at UNC was a 92 before this class, yet she said my writing quality concerned her that I had a learning disability."
6,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Bickford clearly cares about the material quite a bit, and you can tell that it's important to her that she doesn't just tell you about it, but that you learn it. She also gives very informative feedback on the papers, all of which are very short besides the final. Highly recommend!"
7,5.0,4.0,0,0,"By far the best professor I've had at Carolina. She is engaging and really cares about her students. The readings are tough, and she's a hard grader but if you're willing to work for it this class is a must!"
8,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Bickford is one of the most genuine Professors at UNC. She truly cares about her students and strives to treat everyone with respect. I'm not going to lie- she's a tough grader, but she gives awesome feedback and will most definitely help you to become a better writer. This class reading and writing heavy."
9,1.0,3.0,0,0,"The content itself is interesting and so is class discussion, but the grading process is convoluted. It is extremely different to improve grades on writing assignments because the process it nit-picky and no rubric is given. Little feedback given and she doesn't specify where you lose points. Take a different political thought class for poli major."
10,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Bickford is one of the most brilliant and kindest people you'll meet. She's not just a good professor, but a phenomenal teacher as well. I appreciate her dedication to class. Her courses are well-organized and cover a good variety of topics. The type of writing she expects is likely different from what you're used to. A's are uncommon."
11,4.0,4.0,1,0,"Dr. Bickford is a great professor in that she's incredibly knowledgeable and cares about the subject and her students. In this class, you have to read a lot for each period and write papers often. She's definitely a tough paper grader and you do have to talk a lot consistently to get a decent participation grade. Not an easy A, but rewarding."
12,5.0,4.0,1,0,"Professor Bickford is a wonderful teacher and facilitator in class. Get ready to read--a lot! Some familiarity with reading philosophy papers will help you a lot in this class. She really cares about you as both a student and a human being, and is so helpful in and out of class! Highly recommend taking this class, even though an A is unlikely."
13,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Bickford is incredible!!! Definitely one of the tougher graders at UNC, but I have learned so much from her class! Readings are a lot and often v dense, but if you genuinely want to learn and improve as a student, you should take a course form her! Also so willing to help students if they need it!"
14,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Bickford is amazing! A tough grader, but genuinely wants to help improve your writing and critical thinking. I have improved as a writer from taking this course. Lots of reading, very discussion based and small group work. Lots of writing but all of the material is incredibly interesting and she does an amazing job leading discussions!"
15,5.0,4.0,0,0,"The material is super interesting and Professor Bickford clearly cares about it. Classes are structured around participation, which makes it all extremely engaging and enjoyable. Professor Bickford is helpful and very supportive."
16,2.0,5.0,1,0,"She is a harsh grader- does not like giving out anything higher than a B-. It should be a good discussion based class, but she makes it so difficult that no one ends up learning because they're so worried about their grades."
17,4.0,4.0,1,0,"She is an AWESOME professor. However, she runs the class almost like a graduate seminar- there is an incredible amount of reading, and you have to print out everything. For our class, this was about 400 pages per person. RIP to my CCI Printing money. She is a tough grader, almost unneccessarily so, but she cares about how you do in the class."
18,5.0,4.0,1,0,"Excellent class. It's not an easy course for anyone just to slack and get a good grade, but if you work for it, it's surely worth it. Professor is super helpful, friendly, and inspiring. Class discussion is always in a great atmosphere. professor smiles when you talk to her, and she gets so excited when someone come up with good thoughts!"
19,5.0,4.0,1,1,"Professor Bickford is a great professor. The first year seminar I took with her is one of my favorite courses I have ever taken at UNC. If you're taking it because you expect an easy A, you probably won't get it. But the class discussions are incredibly interesting, and you will improve your writing and analytical thinking skills."
20,5.0,3.0,2,2,"Great prof!  Really let's everybody tell what they think about the questions at hand.  Also, she's very serious about participation so don't think that you can join her class and not talk or do the readings, which can get dull at times.  However, the great discussions make it all worth it."
1,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr Boettiger is far and away my favorite prof at UNC and NSCI420 is my favorite class. She's been fantastic at online classes and is super flexible, always asking for feedback. Her lectures are fantastic in my opinion, and though the class is pretty difficult, she's always open to help you and is so incredibly caring. Cannot recommend her enough!"
2,5.0,5.0,2,0,"Dr. Boettiger is awesome and one of the best professors I've had at UNC. Her passion for neuroanatomy is inspiring and she articulates her grading policies very clearly, hardly ever deviating from the syllabus with regards to weekly quizzes and exams. Functional Neuroanatomy is a very tough course, however, and must be prioritized to succeed."
3,5.0,4.0,3,0,Professor Boettiger is one of the best professors I've had so far at UNC. Neuroanatomy is a hard subject with an insane amount of material to cover but she teaches it really well. Every lecture is fascinating. Her tests and assignments are hard but she's very compassionate about grading and is always willing to adjust if the entire class does badly
4,3.5,5.0,0,0,"She's really nice and funny, but the class was difficult. I have a passion for neuroscience, but I could only pull a B in this class because it was so hard. There's a lot of content so beware of that. Even though it's listed as a psych class, it has the amount of work and rigor as a science class (and it doesn't count for the neuroscience minor!)."
5,4.0,3.0,0,0,"I loved this class. Boettiger is super into what she teaches and she makes it fun. Don't get me wrong, it's still biopsychology which is hard and sometimes a bit dry but she does a good job of allowing students to show what they've learned and get credit for it in tests and extra credit opportunities. She's super cool and experienced."
6,4.5,4.0,0,0,"This class is pretty difficult due to the course material, but she is one of the best at explaining and answering questions. The class doesn't technically require attendance but there is an in class quiz every week that you have to be there for."
1,5.0,2.0,2,0,"Easily the best. Profoundly clear, funny, and authoritative but not intimidating or pretentious. Lecture is paced and styled in a way that you'll remember things for years to come."
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Buzinski is hands down one of the best professors at UNC! His lectures are really engaging and he does a good job of making content understandable. He is a very fair grader, offers extra credit opportunities, and has non-cumulative exams that you can do well on if you take notes and pay attention in class."
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr.B is clearly passionate about what he teaches and teaching in general! His lectures were long but interesting. His grading criteria was very clear, and the assignments were all very easy. On exams we were allowed to bring in an index card of notes, but if you looked over your notes you didn't need it."
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. B is an amazing professor. If you ever get the chance to take one of his classes, I recommend you do it, even if you have to move around other classes. No cumulative final, bring a handwritten index card to each test, funny clip from the office at the start of the class. The work is a bit time consuming but easy and content is interesting."
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,This was one of the best psychology classes that I've taken at UNC. It wasn't a lot of work compared to some others. There was one quiz per week based on readings and one assignment per week for our project which were always easy. A lot of your grade is made up of exams but they weren't hard if you studied at all. He also offers extra credit. 
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,Buzinski teaches a great class that he makes fun and interesting. Projects and participation are both easy if you put in any effort at all. He really wants you to succeed so don't be afraid to ask questions.
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,I loved Dr. Buzinski and the Gil Internship! He's so kind and personable and genuinely wants you to succeed.
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Buzinski is amazing. Class is super fun, assignments are fair. He gives you the tools to prepare and do great and it isn't hard to do that, you just have to be willing to put in a little bit of work. I'll specifically looking to take more of his classes. I absolutely recommend Dr. B."
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Fave class at UNC so far, both bc of Dr. B and because the material is so fascinating! This was by far one of the best structured courses I've ever taken. There is a good amount of work but it is easy to do well if you stay on track, and everything you learn is useful and applicable. Highly highly recommend!! "
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Buzinski is really amazing and caring professor. He is my favorite psychology professor in UNC. He is really funny and understanding. The work for PSYC260 is easy and the workload is acceptable. Exam is easy, you just need pay attention during his lectures and make some notes. I would definitely take his higher level psychology course again."
10,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Buzinski is an amazing teacher and a great person. If you have the chance, take any of his courses. PSYC260 had a lot of work but it wasn't really time consuming and most of it was easy. Seriously take this class if you're considering it "
11,5.0,3.0,0,0,I love Professor Buzinski! He is super nice and understanding with everything and is very quick with his emails. His class has a lot of work however it all helps with the course material and is not super time consuming. His lectures are always fun and not boring and they prepare you well for the exams.
12,5.0,4.0,0,0,I've had Buzinski for 2 courses (260 & 566) and he is hands-down my favorite professor at UNC. He is passionate about what he teaches and it translates into a great learning experience. I have learned the most from his classes and he makes every class fun and educational. Highly recommend!
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,Love Dr. B... I have now had him twice (260 & 566) and he is amazing. Take any class with him you can. He expects you to know your stuff when it comes to exam time but he prepares you well
14,5.0,3.0,0,0,"One of the best professors at UNC! Dr. B has engaging lectures and is always super reasonable and flexible. There is a decent amount of work that goes into the class though- a semester long project, weekly chapter readings, weekly before class material quizzes, after class quizzes. There are 3 tests which are average but the final isn't cumulative."
15,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. B is super kind and understanding. He moved deadlines back for us a few times, and he likes to start class off with a funny YouTube clip every day. The class itself is a lot of work, and A is set at 94. It's not impossible to get an A, but you will have to put extra time into this class."
16,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. B is the best professor I have ever had. He's funny, kind, and makes class interesting. PSYC260 does take some effort to do well, but if you just show up to class and take notes, you will do perfectly fine on exams. The class project can seem intimidating at first, but it becomes very easy. He also gives plenty of extra credit. I recommend him!"
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Hands down, Dr. B is the best professor I've had at UNC. He is so kind and understanding, and he made this class one of my favorites ever. There are weekly readings with questions, but all the info is on Quizlet. There's a group project and 3 total exams, but they aren't hard if you just watch the lectures (which are great btw)."
18,5.0,2.0,0,0,I love Buzinski!
19,4.0,4.0,1,0,"Dr. B is cool and kind, but his class was a lot of work (but interesting material). There was textbook reading, a 30 question quiz, a PPT lecture, an essay, and a 10 question timed quiz each week. He was willing to give extensions and accommodations if needed. Enjoyable class and a nice guy, but a lot of work!"
20,4.0,2.0,1,0,"Dr. B is a cool dude but I wouldn't take his class unless you're okay with writing a weekly essay and reading the textbook (which was free!). The essays were low-stakes and not graded harshly at all, though. Overall, however, Dr. B is very relatable, funny, and laid-back. Tests are based on lectures, and weekly quizzes are based on textbook."
1,2.0,3.0,0,0,"It's clear that Professor Cai cares about his students and is very knowledgeable about research. However, he has difficulty explaining the concepts in a way for students to understand. His lectures confused me more than I was. The textbook is more of a workbook and explains no concepts. Be ready to teach yourself. No clear rubrics for anything. "
2,3.0,3.0,1,0,"Professor Cai isn't the best lecturer but as long as you read the book and teach the majority of the information to yourself you will be fine. Grades consisted of weekly Homework and Labs, occasional quizzes, and three exams. Difficult questions unless you study. Not an impossible course, learn R as well. "
3,2.0,3.0,0,0,Stat was really hard and confusing. Nothing was that hard just confusing and weird. Prof Cai has a thick accent so if that is distracting for you I wouldn't recommend because lectures are so helpful in understanding the content. Midterm and final were hard. 
4,1.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Cai is incredibly out of touch with his students. He lectures all class long (boring lectures) and does not interact with us, and then gives us exams that over half the class fails because they are way too long and test us on content most of us don't understand. Pretty sure he doesn't know any of our names. Not sure how I will pass..."
5,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Cai is a very sweet man and very interested in his field. However I expected this class to be more policy based- it is a straight demography class (migration, mortality, fertility based). Unless you are specifically interested in the topic I would avoid as it was very hard for me to get interested. He is accessible and was not hard to pass"
6,4.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Cai was very easy to get ahold of by email or in office hours if you need extra help. There was sometimes a communication gap but overall there werent many assignments and pretty easy to get a good grade as long as you put in a little effort.
7,2.0,3.0,0,0,He's very disorganized as a professor and it's difficult to follow along. Honestly didn't learn much and idk how I passed. His TA is very helpful tho
8,4.0,2.0,0,0,"This class is easy but lectures can be pretty boring. If you read the textbook your solid. There were ""pop quizzes"" that you can take unlimited times and he was very clear about what will be on the midterm. Not the most interesting topic but he's really into it and there's very little work to do for this class."
9,3.0,2.0,0,0,"He is a nice guy and the class is easy, but his lectures are incredibly boring, long, and scattered. He was not clear on grades and took a long time to grade/ wouldn't post scores and did not follow syllabus. Occasional pop quiz on reading. He will tell you what's on the test and it isn't challenging. Interesting topic that could be taught better."
10,1.0,4.0,0,0,"Honestly, I don't see how I'll make it through the semester. The class is so disorganized and the textbook being used is so vague and misleading. At this point, I'll be happy to pass the class just enough to get the credit for the major. The quizzes are no-sense and I feel like I'm learning nothing at all."
11,1.0,4.0,0,0,Hard to understand. Unclear and confusing in explanations. Makes things harder and more confusing than necessary.
12,4.0,3.0,0,0,The content of this class was pretty difficult but Professor Cai really cares about his students and want everyone to do well. Him and his TA were also both easily accessible outside of class. If you make sure you truly understand the homework assignments then you should be fine on the exams.
13,1.0,3.0,0,0,Every week there's an online quiz you have to take and you're supposed to use the textbook but there are unlimited attempts to the quiz and he said you could guess and keep re-doing it until you get a 100. Buying the textbook is a waste of money. For the tests just review the powerpoints and do the study guide. There's a final group paper
14,4.0,1.0,0,1,Professor Yong is very sweet but the class is just very uninteresting and his lectures tended to ramble. But the class was very easy since you could retake online quizzes unlimited times and he tended to tell you exactly what would be on the midterm and final. So most of the time you don't really need to pay much attention.
15,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Prof. Yong Cai's class was one the of the best at UNC. After readings some of the reviews about the thick accent I hesitated to take the course, but I'm so glad I eventually did. I had no issue understanding lectures. He's one of the sweetest persons at UNC, but also it's an EASY A if you are willing to show up to class and read the book."
16,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Cai was the sweetest professor I've had at UNC. He has a thick accent, which makes it hard to follow his lectures, but have no fear: he posts his lecture powerpoints on Sakai & he lays out very clear study guides for both the midterm &final, if you study with the guides and his powerpoints- you can make an easy A. He's also super friendly"
17,1.0,1.0,0,0,"He's not a very good lecturer, which, combined with his very heavy accent, made it nearly impossible to follow along with the lectures. He told us EXACTLY what would be on the midterm, and the final wasn't bad. Easy to get an A if you're willing to put the work in, but don't take it because you think it may be interesting. He's nice & fair though."
18,2.0,1.0,0,0,Prof Cai is nice but isn't very supportive during class. Class  seemed to drag on even when the material was interesting. The homework isn't difficult but attention to detail is very important. The TA was more accessible than Cai. Overall the class wasn't too hard- just study the powerpoints (posted online) and the books readings.
19,2.0,2.0,2,0,"Professor Cai is really nice, but struggles with his English and explaining concepts. I got an A, but I felt confused 99% of the time."
20,2.5,3.0,0,0,Professor Cai is skilled when discussing or using data analysis software. What he could stand to improve from is articulating concepts and relating them back to the class example. There were lots of times someone asked a question and he would answer in a detailed and unspecific way you wouldn't remember what the original question was. Read the book
1,3.0,1.0,0,0,"Extremely passive aggressive professor, but overall a very easy class. I took SOCI100 and it was rather interesting, but the way he lectured was terribly boring. On-time submission will typically lead to an 100% on the assignment, except the final and midterm were significantly more difficult. Staying on top of reading the textbook definitely helps"
2,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Overall one of the worst professors I have experienced at UNC Chapel Hill. His lectures covered trivial topics that had no relevance whatsoever to the test material. Furthermore I can confidently say I left his class with a lower IQ than I entered thanks to his abstract ""Sociological"" Theories. 10/10 would recommend he gets let go!"
3,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Caren is great! The exams are the hardest part of the class, so definitely take the practice tests many times. However, there are a lot of other assignments to balance out exam grades. The final exam included questions from the midterms, so definitely go back and review those questions when the final comes along. Very knowledgeable guy. "
4,2.0,5.0,0,0,"Lectures are not helpful, just read the books. Hard to get good grades. The class has tons of assignments. However, the exams largely determined the grade (so even if you got 100 on every other assignment you might still mess the grades up) and it test literally everything. Never got exam scores higher than 85 and ends up with an A-."
5,3.0,2.0,0,0,"The lectures and readings for this class can be pretty long. The class consists of applications, case studies, film discussions, inquizitive, midterms, and the final. TA's are great and allow you to resubmit applications if necessary. You need to thoroughly study all of the vocabulary in the textbook. Take practice tests MULTIPLE TIMES. "
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Grading criteria is super clear. You can get a decent grade without putting in much effort. Lecture can be interesting and Neal is knowledgeable. The exams are likely the worst part of the class but even then, the reviews and Quizlet help with studying. Overall, not a bad course if you're looking for an interesting elective that isn't too rigorous."
7,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Neal Caren, I love you so much. Best professor I've ever had hands down. I took this for PH credit and had so much fun. Truly got to be me in this class and have never had a better time. Neal literally catered IP3 for our final... king. Easy A if you put in a little bit of effort and honestly such a rewarding class... gonna miss this class so much"
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,I was super nervous about Caren's 274 section because the teaching method was so unusual (you have to take on the perspective of historical figures) but I learned so much and this class was something I looked forward to. Dr. Caren is super chill and we had a pizza party during our final if that says anything. Take this class!!!
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,Dude is hilarious and clearly knows a lot about sociology. Assignments are fairly easy to complete and have very clear grading criteria. Has offered extra credit opportunities throughout the semester as well. Tests are pretty difficult so I recommend actually studying for a couple days in advance. Very helpful and has interesting classes as well. 
10,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Prof Caren is funny and his lectures always have something that make me laugh. Multiple extra credit opportunities. Know the key terms/do the practice exams before exams and you should do well. Not a hard class to succeed in if you put in some effort and understand the material, was never stressed about this class. "
11,5.0,3.0,1,0,"Super knowledgeable and great at facilitating a hands-off experience where students can truly immerse themselves in the simulation. Will help when you're stuck. A lot of reading is required to truly understand the material, and you have to put in a lot of effort, but it's worth it. Grading not bad. Class is different, but my favorite one I've taken"
12,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Assignments have clear grading criteria and are relatively easy although time consuming. Tests are pretty hard, definitely need to put a good amount of time into studying. "
13,5.0,2.0,0,0,"pretty easy as long as you do the work and study, many movie days and few papers and case studys but nothing too difficult"
14,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I really loved Professor Caren. He was engaging in class and had very clear expectations. His tests are not hard if you take the practice exams he posts a couple of times (there are infinite questions). The applications every week are not hard ... I don't think they are actually graded for content, got 100 on all of them. "
15,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Caren is an AMAZING guy. His classes are fun, entertaining and thought provoking. However, the tests are disproportionately hard compared to his lectures, so be prepared to not do well on those versus other assignments. Overall, highly suggest his course."
16,2.0,4.0,0,0,He's a chill guy and a nice person but there's way too much work he makes you do for a stupid intro to sociology class. Every other teacher gives less work - he's so extra and for no reason. Would have never taken this class if I knew that he made you work like a donkey for even a B.
17,2.0,3.0,0,0,The lectures and readings for this class are so boring. There isn't enough engagement in class to keep you focused it's just him talking for 1 hour and 15 minutes straight. The applications also take you a long time and the due dates are too short for a project of that manner. Midterms are okay it's just memorizing like 100+ terms.
18,5.0,2.0,0,0,"SUCH a great professor. Super easy class if you just do the PRACTICE EXAMS MULTIPLE TIMES. Some of the exam answers are on Quizlet if you know where to look; hint use practice exam problems to search. Great and engaging professor. DON'T READ TEXTBOOK. Complete waste of time, j skim for answers and study vocabulary."
19,5.0,2.0,0,0,Prof Caren is an extremely nice professor. He chooses interesting documentaries to watch and is funny with the lectures. He is well respected by the class and there is no way you can get less than a B in this class unless you genuinely do not do anything. Love him!
20,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Professor Caren is a delightful professor. He's kind, funny, and does his best to keep students engaged during lecture. However, much of what is required to succeed in this course comes from the textbook, not the lectures. As long as you do the required readings, the class shouldn't be too difficult."
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Chanon is amazing! She's so sweet, and she tries her best to get to know everyone in the class.  Content was fun, and all assignments were chill.  She has a nice grading system; you can drop lowest midterm and 2 HWs.  HW was graded nicely.  The final was easier compared to midterms/LCs.  Make sure to study a bit. We got 1 point EC for final."
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I thought it was a tough class content-wise, especially compared to her PSYC 230 class. But, Dr. Chanon still has teaching down to a science and is an engaging lecturer. Her grading system is incredibly reasonable too, just make sure you really put in the work for the exams. The final is easy compared to them! "
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,Every lecture was incredibly engaging and she taught the material really well. They were also recorded and posted if you missed a day. Really fair tests too.
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"She was such a caring professor and I rly want to take another class with her before I graduate! She learned everyone's names (and our class is over 100 people)!! It's a lot of material, but she makes it manageable for sure!"
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Chanon is my favorite professor so far at UNC. She cares so much about her students and responds to emails very quickly. Her grading system is very forgiving. Her exams are very straight forward. Plus, she practically does reviews every day. She also makes the lectures interesting by making what we learned relatable. Highly recommend!!! "
6,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Chanon is one of the best professors ever. She learned all her ~100 students' names within the first few weeks of class. Her lectures are well-organized, engaging, and fun. Cognitive Psychology requires lots of memorization, but she makes it durable for her students. I have so many good things to say about her. Highly recommend!"
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,I loved this course! The content was interesting and Dr. Chanon is an amazing lecturer! She really wants all her students to succeed. She was more than fair with all assignments. The workload was manageable. I recommend this class to anybody. 
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,Dr. Chanon is one of the best professors at UNC. She is positive and encouraging toward her students and clearly wants to see everyone succeed. Her tests are pretty straightforward and the posted recorded lectures are great for studying. She was super understanding and flexible with attendance and assignment grading.
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Chanon is really kind and caring. The material wasn't that bad, but she teaches it very well. There are 3 exams but 1 is dropped, and they are pretty easy. As long as you pay attention in class and do the assignments, you will get an A."
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Chanon is super sweet and she teaches the material very well. I felt like I actually learned a lot from her class. You have easy homework due every Friday, 3 exams (1 is dropped), and a few quizzes but you can use your notes. The material is a little hard, but she explains in very well. Tests are fair. "
11,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I loved Dr. Chanon! She's super passionate about neuroscience and she was always ready to answer our questions. The workload was very manageable and the tests were fair. She cares a lot about her students and consistently updates us about the class. Make sure to keep up with the content! Definitely take this class with Dr. Chanon, she's the best! "
12,5.0,3.0,0,0,One of the best at UNC! The way she set up her class was perfect. I feel like I genuinely learnt a lot from the class- the material stuck all semester. Content is cool and she gives great lectures. The 3 tests are kinda challenging but you drop one and the final is easy in comparison. You can miss up to 6 classes without penalty but should catch up
13,5.0,2.0,0,0,Professor Chanon is a great professor. Textbook was not required for the course and lectures covered all the material that we were tested on. Chanon made this course very stress free and her learning checks were great preparation for the final. She sets this class up for your success and it is easy to pass if you put in the effort!  
14,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Chanon is so incredible it makes me emotional. In a way, I literally felt like her office was a safe space for me because of how caring and helpful she was. She has kids which I think helps her have even more of a heart for college students & their well-being. Her lectures are amazing, the class is very organized, and she is so accessible! "
15,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Chanon is super sweet. The class was not super difficult so long as you study (especially for the learning checks!) The unique part of this class is the UX BeAM project, which while tedious at times was pretty cool to do. There is pretty regular homework, but you don't necessarily have to read the book. Be sure to study the learning goals! "
16,5.0,1.0,0,0,"She was great! It was online and asynchronous, but I still felt very engaged with the class. She also made the material super easy to understand. I have no complaints about her or this class!"
17,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Chanon is funny and so relatable. She is also very caring. Her exams are easy and she accommodates her students well. I would without a doubt take more classes with her, she makes the content very interesting and has her students engage in a way that actually helps.The class content is hard at times but her exams are easy and minimal work"
18,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Chanon truly gives students all the guidance and materials we need to succeed in her class. Her class is well organized, you have decent cushioning for your grades, and most importantly, she's a great lecturer and is really good at breaking down concepts in easy to understand language."
19,5.0,3.0,0,0,I love Dr. Chanon so much I would give her my first born child. The material is not easy but she makes it so understandable and her exams are a direct reflection of what is taught. Amazing professor and incredibly helpful to anyone wanting to get into research. Take her for a class if you can!
20,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Chanon is an amazing professor. She gives you exactly what information you need to know for the exams. If you miss class, you can still get participation credit and lectures are posted online, so that was very accommodating. She genuinely wants you to learn and has everything structured very well. You will definitely get an A if you study well!"
1,2.0,4.0,0,0,"As someone who likes biopsychology and understands it, I didn't like this class at all. Professor Christoffel just read off his slides and his lectures were long and not engaging. Tests were cumulative and unnecessarily difficult which dragged my overall grade down. There is a group project which is easy to get full points on. "
2,5.0,3.0,0,1,"Tbh Dr. C isn't bad.  Sure, the first paper was a little rough, but just the rubric for the others, and you're fine.  Exams were not too awful if you study.  Take- home quizzes/scientist spotlights were grade buffers.  Also, you can always email him to talk about grade issues.  And he always let class out early. Overall, not a TERRIBLE class."
3,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Just don't. Lectures were so painfully boring and sometimes vague and exams were insanely precise. No feedback was given on assignments, you just got a grade for no reason. His exams were SO unorganized, even though they were online and automatically graded they were graded wrong. Do yourself a favor and take it with someone else."
4,2.0,5.0,0,0,He has been one of the worst professors I have had at UNC so far. You basically have to teach yourself the material and the exams are very detailed. He seems to not care about teaching at all and lectures right off of the slides. He doesn't give feedback on papers and the lectures are not engaging at all. Take PSYC 220 with anyone else!
5,1.0,5.0,0,0,Dr. Christoffel was the worst professor I have had so far. It was clear he did not care about his students or teaching in general. He graded extremely harshly with little to no guidance or explanation. Take with someone else!!!
6,2.0,5.0,0,0,"I really did not like Dr. Christoffel because he wasn't good at lecturing, tests were wildly hard, we always left class early (meaning it feels like we missed a lot of content that was still on tests). Group project is easy. There is no feedback on the 4 papers due throughout the semester (got a 76 on one with no explanation). I do not recommend"
7,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Do not recommend. Extremely boring lectures, difficult tests, and he clearly was just not prepared to teach this class. One time the highest exam score was an 89 and he did not curve at all. The group projects and pre-class quizzes did boost your grade, though."
8,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Content is pretty cool; class could have been a lot better if Dr. C was more enthusiastic & accessible. Quite obvious he didn't care much about us, he would answer questions in class but wasn't helpful beyond that. Beginning of class was a wreck as he didn't provide any insight on grading or studying criteria. Tests and lectures are overly detailed"
9,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Not a great professor. Nothing has clear grading standards, you can get a failing grade on a paper with literally no feedback. Exams are hard as hell (all of the test averages are in the 70s) and lectures are short without enough info. Do not recommend. "
10,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Dr. Christoffel's lectures were monotone and didn't really provide anything that you couldn't gain from the book. He tried to take attendance but his pollev's never worked, and while the quizzes were really easy the exams were very hard. We had to beg him to give us a rubric for papers, but at least he lets class out early. Take with someone else!"
11,1.0,3.0,0,0,"He can come off as condescending/rude. He lectures monotone the whole time, and he doesn't even try to keep students engaged. He grades papers harshly and doesn't give feedback. The questions on exams can seem random but aren't too bad if you study. You can get a good grade if you put in the effort, but I'd take this class with anyone else."
1,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Great professor! He was really engaging, encouraged good class discussions, and was open to all students' ideas. Poli 204 was pretty easy when I took it - he gave us study guides for the exams and you can probably get by without doing all of the reading. Class attendance matters, so if you skip you're grade will be impacted."
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Clark is one of my favorite professors at UNC. He is clearly extremely interested in politics and, will often go on tangents in class. A lot of his tangents are really entertaining, though, which make his lectures really easy to pay attention to, with him encouraging lots of participation. His lecture slides are easy to reproduce and useful."
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Take classes with Dr. Clark! He is clearly passionate about the topic and encourages class discussion, which is super interesting. As of fall 2022, there are a lot of readings in this class and your grade is based off of a few assignments, but it is manageable. Not sure if that'll be changed up in the future. Nonetheless, great class."
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Loved Dr. Clark! Lectures are interesting and engaging. Lots of class discussion. Only downsides are that he sometimes rambles and that the class is graded off 2 essays and 2 tests. However, you will learn a lot from the class and the classroom is very engaging and respectful. I would totally take him again!"
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,TAKE THIS CLASS!
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Your grade consists of a midterm, 2 papers, a group presentation, and participation. Prof. Clark is a fair grader for all of those assignments, and is always clear with his expectations. He's clearly invested in what he teaches, which always makes his lectures interesting to listen to. Take this FYS if you have the chance!"
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Clark is definitely one of my favorite professors at UNC. He is very passionate about what he teaches and encourages students to participate. His class consisted of readings, 2 papers, a midterm and a final group project. If you are interested in learning about the topics he teaches I would definitely recommend taking a class from him. "
8,5.0,1.0,0,0,Professor Clark has been my favorite professor so far at UNC. His lectures are engaging and he clearly cares about what he teaches. If you are passionate about the topic of the class then you will surely enjoy taking his classes. He goes out of his way to create an inclusive class environment for all students.
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,I would 100% take Dr. Clark again. He was able to distill difficult information to us in manageable terms. His tests were not too difficult if you watched the lectures. You do not need to read the textbook to get a good grade either.
10,5.0,3.0,0,0,"This was my second class with him, and I loved it! I learned a lot of useful information about Southern politics, and you can tell he loves what he does. He is an engaging lecturer, gives good feedback on papers, and his exams are straightforward. Definitely take him if you have the chance."
11,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Super awesome guy and extremely knowledgeable, but he was slow to grade and we never got lectures on time, which was stressful for the COVID semester. Still a king tho and I would definitely recommend if the class is in person"
12,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Clark is kind and cares about what he teaches, but this class was not enjoyable online. Class was asynchronous, and he sent out lectures SEVERAL days after the day we should have had them. The 2 papers were difficult but the midterm and final were easy! This class was not a lot of work, but I'm not sure if I'd take a class with him again."
13,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Clark is a solid professor! I learned a lot from him and you can tell he is really passionate about the material. He is easily distracted which means his lectures can be a bit convoluted, but I didn't really mind. His class is definitely not an ""easy A"" because the exams are pretty tough, but the papers and projects help make up for that."
14,4.0,3.0,0,0,Clark is so enthusiastic abt his subject and is great at explaining the material even in the asynchronic format. There's A LOT of reading for POLI76 so be prepared but tbh u can skim and as long as u watch lecture u'll get the main points. Not a super harsh grader and there are few assignments other than reading/lecture. 2 papers and 1 group proj.
15,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Great professor. His clear enthusiasm and interest in the topic made me really want to learn. Do your readings, take notes in class, and spend time thinking about the issues and topics this class discusses: you'll do well. Funny guy as well."
16,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Loved having him as a professor this semester! I definitely plan on taking a class with him again. This class isn't necessarily an easy A, as the second midterm and final are pretty difficult. Attendance is taken occasionally, but info directly from lectures is on tests. He is very passionate and makes boring subjects more relevant an interesting!"
17,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Clark shows that a class doesnt need to be insanely hard for you to learn a lot from it. The tests are very consistent with the lectures/readings, and you get to spend a lot of time on discussions and current events. It can get a little dry/awkward if no one is participating, but hes very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what he teaches."
18,5.0,2.0,0,0,Dr. Clark is awesome! One of my favorite professors at UNC. He is hilarious and genuinely cares about his students and is passionate about the class material. He also makes lectures interesting.
19,5.0,2.0,0,0,Clark is one of my favorite professors i've had at UNC. His exams come straight from lecture material so I recommend going to class. Also takes attendance once in a while. A fair grader & made lectures enjoyable! can tell he is passionate about politics & a super nice guy!
20,5.0,4.0,0,0,"My favorite professor at UNC. Absolutely incredible lecturer. I had Dr. Clark for 101 and 204, and thoroughly enjoyed both of them. The grades I received in both classes were not ideal, but that was not necessarily because of him. He's a fair grader and knows how to explain what he's thinking. He's so funny and I never felt nervous in class."
1,1.0,2.0,0,0,"Complete waste of time. Easy diversity credit for poli sci, but get ready to learn nothing. Even though the class is listed as a feminist class, no one is passionate about the material. Any alternative viewpoints are shut down, and if you just regurgitate her viewpoints to her you will get a good grade. The class is all online as well."
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,The class was all online but Professor Conover is great. Flipped classroom but the content is interesting and she never assigns so much that it's overwhelming. Very clear criteria for projects/papers and is a very generous grader. Recommend if you're okay with an online class.
3,5.0,1.0,1,0," Once a week zoom meeting where you discuss class topics. Only 3 group papers (graded very forgivingly), and 3 forums posts. No exams and an easy final project. Very interesting topics covered with low commitment, should be an easy A if you do the work! Professor Conover is very understanding and I highly recommend her!
"
4,4.0,3.0,0,0,"This class was exhausting. Coming from a feminist Poli Sci Major, you can make a good grade but it takes an unnecessary amount of work. Lectures were long and we had soooo much reading everyday. The content is interesting but the format is tiring. Like I said you can make a good grade but its not really worth the work required. "
5,4.0,3.0,0,0,"The class was definitely reading and homework heavy, too much so at times. However, Dr. Conover provided interesting material, was very organized, and fair with quizzes and forum posts. You had to stay engaged, but she was very understanding of special circumstances and was warm and welcoming overall. Would recommend, but be ready to work!"
6,4.0,1.0,0,0,We only had class once a week and hardly any assignments. Frequent short quizzes but they were scheduled. She was very nice but with the class being online it was hard to really form a relationship. A few group projects.
7,3.0,3.0,0,0,I had Conover online and we had one meeting per week. She is a tough grader and it takes forever for her to grade stuff. Her grading criteria is nitpicky + difficult to please. She has a horrible internet connection and class is therefore difficult. Her work is organized but you have to teach yourself everything. She did not answer emails promptly.
8,2.0,4.0,0,0,"I did not enjoy POLI 217 or Professor Conover all that much at all. I felt like she relied heavily on her out-of-class work and felt like the ""lectures"" were really just a discussion on how other students saw the problems discussed in that week's material instead of her actually teaching. Essentially, I taught myself the material. Not fun"
9,2.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Conover is clearly a well educated individual in Political Science and I do like her but the amount of articles, essays, and other readings she assigns on a week to week basis was overwhelming. Also, she is hard to get a hold of consistently and if you are not in class with her, her responsiveness was poor."
10,2.0,3.0,0,0,"I found the subject matter boring and her approach to be somewhat as well. Any time you have a relatively boring subject and the teacher is not very energetic about it, I find it to be hard to learn. I also thought the method she taught the course made it harder for success in her class."
11,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I loved Professor Conover for Poli 63. The class is so interesting and Conover is so nice and makes understanding the material easy. She makes PowerPoints for you to listen to, which go by fast, I took notes on them to use in class discussions. Please do the readings to be prepared for class, or they will be boring!! Super easy quizzes too!"
12,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Overall good professor and not too rough of a grader, as long as you do forum posts on time, you should be fine. Pretty much an easy A if you put in some work with the readings and the posts and show up and talk in class!"
13,3.0,3.0,0,0,"2 Forums worth 35%. Points lost for posts in quick succession or close to due date. Struggled on forum2 bc of COVID & got a B. Got solid A's on everything else (group project, paper, forum1, etc) but just 1 B dropped my class grade to a B (even if I got 100% on the final). All because of the timing of my (not late) forum posts... during a pandemic."
14,2.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Conover is a nice woman however the class was dull and she was extremely boring. The group projects and assignments had vague guidelines and the majority of your grade was determined by forum posts. It wasn't a very difficult class and the subject matter was very interesting but something about the way the class was run made it bad.
15,5.0,3.0,0,0,i recommend her whenever i can she was great. the online forum posts help your participation grade if you do them diligently especially if you aren't a talk in class person.
16,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Conover is wonderful and interesting in all of her lectures. Its easy to get overwhelmed and fall behind in the readings and the blog posts, but she makes the work worth it."
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,"You could clearly tell that Professor Conover cared about her students. She listened to our input and stories and showed true concern. There was a lot of reading, but because there are no exams it wasn't necessary to do them. By attending class, participating, posting on forums, and writing the papers (which were graded forgivingly) you will get A."
18,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Took Poli50 and Poli217 because I liked her so much. She really challenges students in discussion over class material, without implementing her political biases like most professors. If you participate and actually try on assignments, you can get an A. Also, final exams are open note and you get questions beforehand to prepare for."
19,5.0,3.0,0,0,PROF CONOVER IS AMAZING. It is clear she is very knowledgeable in her subject and the lectures are great. Attendance is via poll everyone questions on the readings and the readings are pretty interesting. 10/10 take this class if you can.
20,5.0,2.0,0,0,Professor Conover made classes fun and interesting. Grading wasn't super difficult and there weren't any tests. She's a super sweet person and I really liked this class!
1,4.0,1.0,0,0,Easy first year seminar and she is a really understanding professor. Very low stress class so I'd recommend for anyone looking for an easy FYS.
2,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Professor Cooper has all the qualities that a first-year seminar instructor should. She is understanding, flexible, and care's about her students. She is also very knowledgable about what she teaches. The class was easy as long as you show up for attendance. A few papers make up the majority of your grades and the topics are easy to write about."
3,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Professor Cooper is seriously amazing. I learned SO much in this class, and it was super easy. 3 papers (2 because of COVID), a take-home midterm, and that's pretty much it. If this course is offered and you need a fun class, definitely take it!"
4,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Cooper is one of the most caring and engaging professors I've had at UNC. We had a total of 3 papers all semester, but she's very flexible and gives extra credit opportunities. As long as you show your enthusiasm for her class and show up regularly, you'll pass."
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I loved this class. The topics were really interesting and she is really good at helping you understand them. As long as you pay attention and put some effort into assignments, you can definitely get an A. She is really helpful and makes the class pretty fun!"
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Easily one of the best professors I've had at UNC. Assigned readings are important and coincide with homework assignments, but pretty easy grader and the activities help to understand class content. Lots of class discussion, he really cares about his students and respects what they have to say. If you can get into a class with him, take it!"
2,3.0,3.0,0,0,"This class was alright. It wasn't my favorite, but I didn't hate it. The class has a ton of reading and several papers that you'll have to finish in a night or two. Most classes are lecture heavy, but you do a couple of fun interactive activities. The prof is super understanding and kind, the material is just not my favorite."
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Crescenzi was awesome. Easily one of the best professors at UNC. Seriously, any class you can take with him, take it. You can tell he genuinely loves teaching and cares for his students. Felt really out of depth going into this course but felt fully prepared for the exams just from readings/class discussions"
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Crescenzi is one of the best professors I've had! He is so caring, funny, and engaging in class. His deep knowledge and wide range of experience in international politics make his lectures very interesting. He is a very easy grader, but just be prepared to write a lot of essays. I know he loves helping students find opportunities, too!"
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Crescenzi is the best. His course was very well adapted to the pandemic, he's understanding of all perspectives, and gives room to express your own beliefs and thoughts freely. The course structure was mostly asynchronous and super flexible. The grading seems TA dependent but his TA's are awesome. Take this class!"
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Crescenzi is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. He really cares about his students and the course material. He was really understanding with the pandemic and tried to accommodate the class with the needs of students. I highly recommend taking a course with him if you can.
7,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Crescenzi is an underrated teacher at UNC. Was understanding of the situations of students during the pandemic and took it into account throughout the semester with syllabus adjustments. Lectures were rather interesting as he often tied it to current events. All assignments are graded by your TA, so the experience can vary by recitation."
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof Crescenzi is one of the best professors I've had. He was very understanding and has done so much to make the learning experience more enjoyable and less stressful in light of the course going online due to covid. The class is fairly straightforward, and he makes the material super interesting and well spaced-out. Would definitely take again!"
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof. Crescenzi is the chair of the Political Science Department, and he is truly a gem. He is so kind, understanding, and down to earth. He wants students to succeed and will work with you to ensure you do. He is very well read and knowledgeable but is purposeful in making sure his students are receptive. I would definitely take his class again!"
10,5.0,3.0,0,0,Great Class! I love Professor Crescenzi. He did so good giving us the perfect introduction to international relations. I had this class online because of Corona. He was so caring and really helped all of us out. I loved this class!
11,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof. Crescenzi is one of the best I've had at UNC. He's SO incredibly kind and was extremely accommodating with COVID. He's passionate about what he teaches and genuinely cares about students. Class consisted of a midterm, final, and 8 one-page writing assignments graded by your TA. Take a class with Crescenzi if you can!!!"
12,5.0,3.0,1,0,"Prof Crescenzi is one of the kindest and most empathetic educators I've ever seen and taking his class made this entire online semester that much more enjoyable. He encourage feedback like no prof I've seen before. He's reminds of a skinnier political science genius Santa Clause. If you get the chance to be in one of his classes, go for it!"
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Great professor- as a senior I have NEVER seen a prof actually accommodate students on this level. Though there are weekly writing reports, there is no central essay. My TA graded somewhat harshly but turned out ok in the end. Midterm probs relates more to TA. Mark always checks in and actually hears students, it's beyond."
14,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Asynchronous. Love this professor & can't wait to take another class with him. Acknowledged the pandemic & our stress & lightened our load to the extent possible. 8-10/16 1-page writing assignments are counted, one midterm, one final, participation. I liked my TA & I liked the material. A little boring at times but recommend taking online."
15,5.0,2.0,1,0,"THE MOST AMAZING PROFESSOR !!! He actually acknowledges that we are in a pandemic right now !! Not only does he want each student to succeed, but he shows that he cares by constant encouragement throughout the semester in emails/Zoom meetings !! He is always available and helpful during office hours, easy to talk to, and has great lectures !!!"
16,5.0,5.0,1,0,"Prof. Crescenzi is amazing! So understanding of students' needs, good lectures. Super knowledgeable but knows how to teach an intro class in a way that is perceptible and interesting. This class is not hard to get a good grade in if you do the work. It gives you a great toolkit to continue learning about POLI!"
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,Crescenzi is the best prof ever. He was so accommodating because of COVID and online learning. For example he basically cancelled our final which relieved so much stress off me. His lectures were super helpful and the writing assignments were not difficult. He gave us so many opportunities to get As. And the TAs are all awesome. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!
18,5.0,1.0,0,0,Dr. Crescenzi is awesome. i personally found the class really boring but that probably bc it was asynchronous! prof made this class a little better by giving really clear and helpful lectures and being super understanding. the online class is very well designed and adapted
19,5.0,3.0,0,0,Mark Crescenzi is an angel. The material can be heavy but he breaks everything down as much as possible in his lectures and is readily available outside of class to discuss anything you don't understand. He is one of my best-adapted professors to the online format and is still always willing to adjust assignments and exams to help students. Async.
20,5.0,3.0,0,0,"His lectures are interesting and he is very accessible outside of class. He adjusted to online classes extremely well and he lightened the workload wherever he could to help us out. The class does have a lot of reading, but it's not too difficult and you'll do fine if you keep up with the reading and lectures. I could not recommend him more."
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"One of the best professors. He was nice and funny, and he also knows what he's teaching really well. He gives good lectures--clear, concise, and hilarious."
2,4.0,2.0,1,0,Prof Curran is funny and eloquent. He's an academic that you can feel comfortable talking to outside of class. Lectures were a bit loose but the midterm and final were graded very fairly.
3,2.5,4.0,0,0,"terrible class, lectures unclear and all he makes sure hes clear about is voicing his liberal opinions"
4,4.5,3.0,0,0,"Great teacher who makes the subject interesting.  Provides class slides online, so going along with lectures are relatively easy.  Homework isn't terrible, and the tests are relatively easy so long as you've studied."
5,5.0,4.0,0,0,WONDEFUL! Makes stats understandable. Is always available and classes are as entertaining as they can be with grad stats. He's also a reallhy nice and funny person.
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,very nice man...exams and homework are pretty simple but study for his FINAL!!!
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,nice guy and I miss watching Wallace & Gromit!!
1,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Horrible and unfit professor. Her grading scale is 1-4. She doesn't grade when she says she will. She expects us to complete our tasks by the deadlines, but takes FOREVER to give our grades back. She would say one day and just not release grades by that day. At least send a class-wide email saying that you will be delayed in releasing grades. "
2,1.0,5.0,2,0,Do not take this class! She accused over half of the class of using ChatGTP with no proof. Caused students tons of stress throughout the semester. Never follows through on promises for grades to be released by a certain time.
3,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Seems nice, but isn't understanding or accommodating. Unclear instructions with no office hours, SO hard to reach outside of class, so much work over spring break--this class is essentially all busy work. All of the work over the course of the semester piles up at the end with no leniency to move due dates (or to be kind to students asking for it)."
4,2.0,5.0,0,0,"No tests, but be prepared for long weekly forum posts, readings, random in-class assignments, and worksheets - all with unclear instructions and graded on a 4 point scale. She is hard to get a hold of, a harsh grader, not receptive to questions, and is judgmental/moody in a way that reflects in her communication with students (passive aggressive!)"
5,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Disorganized with deadlines and often forgets to upload class materials or assignments. Very hard to reach by email, and responses are often passive-aggressive. Super unclear grading criteria, very subjective. Lots of busy work and assignments as the course progresses. Graded on a scale of 1-4 for all assignments. "
1,5.0,1.0,0,0,Dr. Duxbury was amazing. This class was super interesting and very manageable. He was very accommodating to those of us without any coding experience. He gave really good feedback and was available outside of class to get help. Can definitely get an A if you show up and do all the work. Highly recommend!
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Scott is one of the best professors I've had at unc! He is so kind and is always available to answer your questions outside of class. Class went by so fast because the discussions were always really interesting and inspirational. He is such a smart and funny professor. Take this class if you can, you wont regret it! "
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I loved this class so much! It was super interesting and not too hard. We had weekly quizzes and biweekly writing assignments, but most of the grade was the midterm and final, which were both open note. I would definitely recommend this class!"
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I took SOCI 318 (not 123) with Professor Duxbury and it was my favorite class I have taken at UNC so far. Professor Duxbury is very understanding and makes content extremely interesting, 10/10 would recommend this class and Professor Duxbury for students within every major!"
5,5.0,1.0,0,0,"I had Scott in Fall 2021, and he's an excellent professor. He's a criminologist so he really knows the subject matter. He's always approachable and very flexible. It would be pretty difficult to get less than an A in his class; just pay attention, do the short assigned writing, and follow the study guide for the midterm/final. Great teacher!"
6,5.0,1.0,0,0,Scott was the greatest Prof I had last semester. He really cared about his students and has a super simple grading scheme. If you show up to class and take the quizzes + exams which are open note then youll be fine. He assigns reading but you can get by without doing them. Definitely a GPA boosting class
7,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Probably the best professor I've had at UNC. The class covers some difficult material, but Scott is great at making it easy to understand. As long as you show up and do your best, you'll get an A."
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,Scott made lectures interesting and always stopped to answer questions and have spontaneous class discussions. All assignments or quizzes/tests were simple and open-note. Class flew by.
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Very clear expectations, good amount of graded items, no one type of assignment (quizzes, papers, participation, exams) was weighted too heavily. He's always willing to explain and discuss topics. Readings only mattered for the weekly quizzes, not exams. Midterm and finals were direct from study guide."
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,Professor Duxbury is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is so intelligent and explains concepts clearly. I've learned so much in his class. He is also caring and will work with you if things come up. He is clearly more interested that we learn in his class rather than being a tough grader. Highly recommend taking his classes!
11,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Duxbury made this class very enjoyable. He is very transparent about caring for his students and wanting them to learn and does not intend to overload them with homework or give bad grades. The content covered in the course is interesting, and Duxbury does a good job of teaching some difficult machine learning processes. Highly recommend!"
12,5.0,2.0,0,0,"This man has my favorite type of teaching style -- informative but not bulky presentation slides, clear and concise when explaining the material, and encourages engagement from the class. Not to mention he's a very understanding professor. SOCI290 is not hard if you've done stats/R classes, the reading is cool and the HW/quiz aren't hard."
13,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Loved this class! Super easy A--short & easy weekly quizzes, 1-page reflections every other week, an easy midterm & final. Classes were interesting, would definitely recommend."
14,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Computational Sociology is a really interesting class. Although a very complex topic, Scott makes it seem clear through his lectures. The work is hard, but he walks you through the R and is very helpful if you need it. Definitely recommend!"
15,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Duxbury gives great lectures that are easy to follow. His tests are very similar to his lectures and are very straightforward and simple. Duxbury is very understanding about late work and the workload is not too heavy. The main grades are from discussion posts, weekly quizzes, and small writing assignments."
16,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Best professor I've had in the 4 years I've been at UNC! He provides the reading material, exams & quizzes were super reasonable, lecture slides are available on Sakai, he explains topics well, has optional zoom meetings during class time, and is super helpful! He's very accommodating to students' needs and is super chill/friendly!"
17,5.0,2.0,2,0,"Probably my favorite professor I've ever had at UNC. The class was a super easy A as well, definitely recommend!"
1,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Assignments were generally easy to complete and the material wasn't hard but the exams felt like you were set up to fail. There wasn't any one I spoke to who felt confident about the exams so no matter how much you study, its not going to work out. Also the group projects felt repetitive. "
2,3.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof Entwisle makes class easy enough, but the big project we worked on all semester was broken into small assignments that felt repetitive. No tests or quizzes though, just open-note in-class assessments, which was great."
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof. Entwisle entirely re-structured the class once COVID started. There were no exams, quizzes, etc - only small individual assignments and a large group project that spanned over about half the semester. Participation is important. Overall I really liked the way the class was designed for online learning and would highly rec this course."
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Her classes are very structured and you can tell she has done this for many years. She is clear about what we are learning and explains concepts well. The vocab quizzes are really easy and straightforward, but you will need to study well for tests. She is a very kind and competent teacher - not sure what others are saying."
5,2.0,2.0,0,0,"She doesn't give tell you much about what's on exams. Exams cover things not always covered in class. Exams have test corrections, but you need them because typically people make in the 70s for her exams without test corrections. Class is a little boring, but just show up."
6,3.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Entwisle is very knowledgeable, but the class got a little boring at times. This seminar on American universities definitely didn't feel like a sociology class."
1,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Amazing class. A lot of material, but an easy A if you stay on top of your material. Lots of feedback to work with though.

She's one of the best professors at UNC if you show sincerity and study hard as well. I know many people who passed with flying colors with no hassle. But some also managed to fail the class, so I guess you need to work a bit."
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"One of the best professors I have had. I am even taking her for another class next semester. I learned so much in her class, but it wasn't the easiest class either. Put in hard work, and you will get an A. "
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,She was one of the most amazing and caring professors I have had. Her class was not difficult as long as you either read the textbook or attend the lectures. She prepares you for the exams very well and makes the content interesting! Definitely take her if you have the chance.
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,She is so easy to talk to and very passionate about what she teaches. She gives group/partner assignments in class that are easy and fun. For each of your exams you have a multiple choice portion and take home writing portion which I think makes her grading very fair. There are weekly low-stakes quizzes which are great in preparation for her exams.
5,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Ive been told shes a bit tougher than other profs for 222, but overall she was a great prof! You can tell she is super passionate abt the subject. Be prepared because the way she writes tests questions is confusing, but the structure of the class made this not such a big deal."
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"She is such an amazing and caring professor! The tests are very straightforward and from the lectures and she gives study guides. The quizzes are very easy from the textbook and there are 4 papers that she grades very easily. She gives extra credit on the tests. Honestly, the best professor I've ever had. I loved her the sweetest. "
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,Professor Fitting is very helpful in her office hours and open to students to share their opinions. This class is a lot of memorization but is easy when you get the hang of it. Take Professor Fitting!! 
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Fitting is the sweetest professor ever. There are 16 quizzes based on the readings (the lowest one is dropped), 5 papers, 3 midterms, and 1 final exam. Dr. Fitting saw that I struggled on the second midterm and provided review sessions to me that helped me to do drastically better on the third midterm. She wants you to do the best in her class!"
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,Dr. Fitting was such a sweet and caring professor. She did a great job at teaching the material while also caring for her students and making sure we understood the material. A true UNC gem.
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Fitting is the sweetest professor I've ever had. She is so caring and makes sure to answer everyone's questions and is very lenient in terms of grading and will extend deadlines as long as you ask. Very flexible and encouraging professor!
6,5.0,2.0,1,0,"6 papers 4 tests but not as intimidating as it seems. Lowest test is dropped and paper can be extra credit. Very clear grading criteria. Show up, work hard, get an A, move on! She's very accessible outside of class and offers a lot of help to aid your success."
7,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Fitting's class is boring but exams are straight memorization and are solely on her PowerPoints (can drop 1 exam). She basically reads off the PowerPoint for the entire class every single day. Only hw is 6 short papers (drops 1) based off the PowerPoints. Definitely have to study for tests, but if you can memorize/ repeat well, you'll do fine."
8,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Fitting is awesome I really enjoyed her class, I also learned a lot. I would recommend taking her for sure. I did pretty well on all of her tests, her Power Points are super useful and great for testing material. I loved the papers, fair, and way better than quizzes. One of my favorite classes."
9,4.0,3.0,2,0,"Dr. Fitting is a pretty good teacher though her English is a little off since she's from Germany. I learned a lot from this course and did great on the first exam but poorly on the last 2 b/c she said ""I made the tests more difficult so ppl would come to class."" You have to do 10 400 word papers for the semester which aren't bad at all."
1,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Very strange grading scale that left little to no room for mistakes. Participation/attendance wasn't graded, but the lectures are basically mandatory if you want to do well. Grades papers extremely harshly and is not very considerate of student circumstances. Also, a lot of reading if you want to do well."
2,1.0,5.0,0,0,Read the prior comments. They are the truth! Would not recommend her class! 
3,1.0,4.0,0,0,Insanely condescending and would criticize students who chose to participate. She grades super harshly on her assignments and has a weird grading scale. She is clearly well-educated in her field and wants to spread a positive message but would say slurs during some of her lectures. Way too hard for a level 100 class.
4,1.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Fitzgerald ruined my second semester. Her lectures are insightful, but I hated everything else in her class. For a 100 level course, it is absolutely not worth it. DO NOT TAKE SOCI 122. Exams WILL be worth at least 70% of your final grade, and she does not curve. If you want your GPA ruined, I would highly recommend. "
5,1.0,4.0,0,0,"She is genuinely the rudest professor that I have had throughout my academic career. She is snarky, non-accommodating, and disrespectful to her students. She is a very hard grader on the written material, and it's not worth getting help from the TAs. The only good thing is that she is knowledgeable, but it seems that she likes to see students fail"
6,1.0,4.0,0,0,Kathleen isn't that bad when it comes to the content of her course it's just her attitude as a teacher that is unnecessary and disrespectful. Don't even think about emailing her about anything related to the course. She would rather send a snarky comment through email than answer your question. Doesn't allow for discussion that differs from hers. 
7,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Fitzgerald is extremely knowledgeable, and I truly enjoyed taking her class. Students were required to complete a 30 hour learning placement, which is a hefty time commitment, but I thought this facet of the course was imperative to true application of the topic. Professor Fitzgerald was a bit foreboding at times, but also quite funny."
8,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Fitzgerald is an okay professor. She is very knowledgeable but can be passive-aggressive during lectures. Her lectures are boring but interesting at the same time. Her exams are a bit tough but she gives you a study guide, USE IT The study guide is very helpful. READ THE CHAPTERS. The chapters are very important. If you don't read you will fail"
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I was nervous reading reviews but Fitzgerald is really sweet and truly cares about her students' wellbeing! Attendance is not taken but if you miss lecture, read the textbook. The study guides she provides are EXTREMELY helpful, use them! 3 exams (30ish MC and 1-2 SA), 2-3 extracurric. activities, fair amt of reading. You can get away w/ skimming. "
10,5.0,4.0,0,0,"122 & 125- She's incredibly knowledgeable about the material. I Never talked in 122, & only a few times in 125, but I showed up to every class and got 100 for participation in both. She gives study guides for midterm/final that you just have to fill in straight from the textbook/notes. 
"
11,3.0,4.0,0,0,I think she gets a bad rap for sometimes good reason but I think she had good intentions and does care. Besides that as long as you put in effort it's relatively easy to achieve a good grade in this class. Midterm and Final are pretty much whatever she lectured on and multiple choice which helps a lot.  
12,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Fitzgerald is not a bad professor at all. She tries her best and is very knowledgeable about the topic being taught in class. If you think of not going to class, think again. Her lectures are interesting but are quick paced and you have to be able to keep up. Note-taking and reading are crucial and very important if you want to pass the class. "
13,5.0,5.0,0,0,I took her for both Soci 273 and 122 last semester.  I worked pretty hard but ended up getting A's in each.  I really enjoyed the classes and learned a lot.  I found out my dad has terminal cancer a few weeks before finals season and she was really accommodating and kind.  She grades papers pretty easy but tests can be hard.
14,5.0,3.0,1,0,"Overall, Professor Fitzgerald was a pretty good professor. The class isn't too difficult, but it's not an easy A if you don't do the work. While the slides she shows during class and the textbook can be helpful for the exams, it's important to listen to what she actually says during lectures as it can give more detail and fix any confusion. "
15,5.0,4.0,1,0,"Dr. Fitzgerald is really great! Her class was definitely not easy and you had to read the textbook chapter before every class to understand what was going on. There were a few quizzes that were 5 points each, a book review (I didn't read it and got an A), two discussion posts, a midterm and a final. Really important class and learned a lot!"
16,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Dr. Fitzgerald is incredibly rude and discouraging over email and in lectures. She is condescending toward students that choose to participate. She is incredibly inaccessible outside of class, and she and the TAs do not give good feedback on the few assignments that you turn in. Save yourself the trouble, and do not take this class."
17,1.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Fitzgerald has some interesting lectures set up, however the class itself is ruined by her attitude towards other students. I often felt discouraged from participating in lecture due to her remarks towards students who spoke. "
18,3.0,3.0,0,0,"SOCI122 is definitely a harder 100 level SOCI class, but the content is important and I think presented well. I do not think Professor Fitzgerald would get the same type of ratings she does if she was a male professor, to quote another review here. If you are interested in the content and want to learn more, do not be afraid to try the class! "
19,1.0,4.0,0,0,"Lectures move slow, but are informative. Attendance is mandatory and the professor can be condescending at times."
20,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Did not find Dr. Fitzgerald to be rude or uncompromising, but she is blunt, outspoken, and passionate. If you keep up with textbook readings, then lectures may be repetitive/boring as they are summaries of chapters. Study guides provided for tests are tickets to an A. Very little homework, interesting content."
1,3.0,3.0,0,0,One of the top scholars in her field. Very knowledgeable. Class was based on lectures and reading/discussing papers. You'll gain a good command of the positive psych literature by the end. Pretty easy A but a lot of little assignments to keep track of. Class was disorganized at first but this is the first time she's run PSYC490.
2,2.0,3.0,3,2,"6 papers you write and she grades very hard. If you don't write the way she wants, she won't give you a good grade. Don't read the books its a waste of time. Overall Barb is a good lecturer, but the material at times can be quite boring. On the plus side there aren't any tests or quizes."
3,5.0,3.0,5,4,"Barb was a special teacher to have for a FYS as a Freshmen. She is a world leader in the Positive Psych field and through reading her books and engaging in hands on positivity interventions. You will not have to worry about getting the A as long as you participate in class and not slack off. If you have the opportunity, you need to take Barb!!"
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I love this class! Dr. Gates clearly explains the material and outlines all expectations. She is available and willing to work with you if you have questions and provides great feedback. Great class to learn more in-depth statistics without being punished for a couple of mistakes. Composed of 5 homeworks, 5 quizzes and a final paper/presentation"
2,4.0,4.0,0,0,"This class was a hard one - the quizzes and homework was pretty tough and I had to rewatch lectures multiple times to understand things sometimes. She is super sweet and accessible though! This class is mostly quizzes (6) and homework (5), but there is a major final group project (no final exam)."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Gaudier-Diaz was the best professor I had my entire first year at UNC. While the readings assigned for the class are dense and hard to process sometimes, she does a spectacular job of making clear what she wants you to know in lectures. 
Also -- attendance isn't mandatory, but it made all the difference in keeping my grade high. Show up!"
2,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Gaudier-Diaz's lectures were interesting and I thought her projects really enhanced my learning. My only complaint with her lectures is you have to write absolutely everything down because her quizzes tend to be quite difficult. However, she is easily approachable and always willing to answer questions. "
3,5.0,4.0,0,0,"It's an upper-level NSCI class, so it's going to be difficult. But it's so interesting! And Dr. Gaudier-Diaz really makes the tough readings so much more understandable during lectures. There are lots of components to the class, but she gives you frequent reminders."
4,4.0,2.0,0,0,"It wasn't the easiest material but as long as you go to the lectures and turn in the small assignments, you will be fine. She isn't there to make the class harder. There are 3 writing assignments over the semester and a quiz before each class that is easy to do after reading. She has a lot of extra credit and all exams are take home/online."
5,1.0,5.0,0,0,Her class was much more difficult than it needed to be - it took an interesting topic and turned it into a painful/stressful topic. Her grading criteria is never clear. Her quizzes/exams are very hard and lecture notes only help with about 50% of the questions. She is not too receptive to feedback and makes you feel small. 
6,1.0,4.0,0,0,"I wouldn't recommend taking a summer class with her. She rarely responds, her exams are so hard, and the amount of work for a 100 level course is a lot. She doesn't work with you much at all either, especially with summer conflicts."
7,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Flipped classroom style, so if that's not for you, steer clear. Readings are dense but you can kind of go off lecture slides and find YT videos to explain material better than textbook would. Consists of 2 reading quizzes a week, class participation, 1 group project, 3 writing assignments, 3 tests, some other activities, and a final. "
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Don't get me wrong, this class is challenging, and there is a lot of material to cover, but Dr. Gaudier-Diaz is very clear about what to know and what she expects of you. She is really nice, clearly loves the subject, and is passionate about making the class structure around student feedback. "
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Gaudier-Diaz is fantastic. Her class does require a lot of reading, and each reading is important, but the readings are not difficult to comprehend. She is clear with what she wants, and she provides cushion for grading. She's very nice, and really cares about the material. I would 100% take her class again. "
10,2.0,3.0,0,0,"spare your sanity and never take a summer class with her. prof was very disorganized, hard to get ahold of, and less than helpful. the work is not hard but the lecture videos don't cover pretty much anything on the exams. prof has been impossible to get in contact with when there is confusion--and there's a lot of it. would not recommend. "
11,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. GD is fantastic! She doesn't place all the emphasis on exams, which is extremely helpful. There's a lot of reading, but I really only focused on her lectures for exams. The assignments she gives are sometimes time-consuming, but the grading is lenient."
12,3.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof. Gaudier-Diaz is nice and offers easy extra credit along with lots of participation points, exams are all open note, only three writing assignments throughout the semester. Reading outside of class is definitely necessary because her lectures move fast and she tends to get rushed towards the end and skip over topics that could be on the exam."
13,3.0,2.0,0,0,"my best tip to do well on exams is to take the lesson objectives (which the exams are based on) and organize everything that applies to them from book and lecture notes into a study guide after covering each chapter(aka after every class). try to do this as you go along instead of before the exam, helped me tremendously. also so much reading  "
14,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Gaudier-Diaz is a great and caring teacher! You do have to read a good chunk of a dense textbook before every class, but she would explain concepts in a very understandable way. At times, the lecture slides were a bit disorganized. The concept maps, group project, writing assignments, and three midterms all had fair grading criteria. "
15,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Not a bad Professor by any means, but her contributions to your learning are pretty limited, as she essentially just reiterates textbook reading through slideshows. She is knowledgeable about the subject however and has a kind tone in her lectures. If you study, the tests are not bad, and the quizzes come straight from the textbook (dense reading)."
16,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Gaudier was great for this course. She studies the content through her research so you can tell she is very passionate. Lectures are not recorded, so you must come to class. There is no textbook so you have to make sure you listen word for word what she says during lecture. Fair quizzes and there are many projects/papers that are graded fairly!"
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,I loved her lectures and the structure of the class. You do have to do the textbook readings to get a good understanding of the material but all of the assignments and projects were really easy and fun to do. I learned a ton.
18,3.0,5.0,0,0,"Dear God these readings will be the death of me. Literally dont do them, its a waste of time and wont leave u with enough time to actually STUDY for exams. Just take notes off the ppt. Monica is nice enough and she certainly knows her stuff. She also offers lots of office hours. The material is just dense"
19,4.0,5.0,0,0,"Professor Gaudier-Diaz had a very structured class which was helpful. She is caring and is there for her students. The reading is extremely dense and there is A LOT of it. Personally, the structure was not the most beneficial for me but I admire her organization. She has clear expectations and guides to her exams. Great professor for being so new!"
20,5.0,3.0,0,0,"She is very sweet, supportive, and accommodating. Don't worry if you do not have a strong NSCI background coming into class. Even though there's lots of readings, use the supplemental videos/other resources! The two-minute neuroscience videos on YouTube are also very helpful! She explains concepts very well in at review sessions and office hours."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I'm not done with the class yet, but if you are considering taking POLI 287 with Professor Gent, I 100% think you should. The material is very straightforward, and Gent actually teaches the material (you aren't left to struggle and learn game theory on your own). Definitely take this class."
2,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Gent is a great political science professor. For someone who had never taken a POLI class before, I found even the more complex material fairly easy to understand when he explained it. The lectures are a little dry, but it's clear he cares about the material and students, and is always willing to give partial credit where it's due."
3,4.0,3.0,0,0,I have really enjoyed Professor Gents class. His lectures are not always super interesting or engaging but they are solid. He is straightforward and a good teacher. He explains game theory well and really wants his students to succeed. A solid choice.
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"She's so nice and caring. Assignments are easy and you only have to do ten throughout the semester, and there's one big project that will start near the beginning of the semester and is due in the middle of the semester which reduces the stress greatly during finals and big project seasons. Frequent group work and quick presentations during class."
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Gil was a joy to have!! Like someone else said, she assigns the big project at the beginning of the semester to make midterm and final season more manageable. She is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, which shows in her lectures! She also is very accessible outside of class and is happy to help you if you need it."
3,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Y'all hating on Dr. Gil for no reason. The assignments are super easy. Some of them require coming to class and doing small group discussions, but they're graded for completion. The project is simple, just put effort into it. Literally just study the powerpoint and read the required chapters for the tests! Plus Dr. Gil is so nice and personable."
4,5.0,1.0,0,0,"The harsh reviews are mind-blowing. She was the most understanding professor I've had at UNC. Complete 10 assignments for 20% of your grade, she front-loads the semester so stress decreases with time. Attendance isn't mandatory but some assignments require you to be in class to complete them. Assignments are graded by a checkmark. I recommend it."
5,1.0,5.0,0,0,She was probably the meanist teacher I've ever had. I had some one on one time with her and she was grunting loudly about how unhappy she was to help me. She made snarky comments to me. She was a tougher grader. 
6,1.0,4.0,0,0,"The content is interesting, but her lectures were extremely boring. She is definitely a harsh grader when it comes to the exams. I thought they were unfairly short with less than ten questions. Obviously, just missing one question sets you back a lot. She also wants extremely detailed short answers. Take another psyc class."
7,3.0,3.0,0,0,"This class is low key hard, Gil is a tough grader. She looks for specific details and information on exams. You really have to do the readings and take thorough notes or be really good at skimming the textbook if you want a decent grade in this class. Be sure to read the research articles as well and take notes about them. Assignments are easy."
8,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Not gonna lie, I was super excited for this class and did not enjoy it at all. Her exams are all super niche, making you memorize paper author names, and don't represent what we learn. She is also not super up front with communication in an online class setting and I feel kind of just along for the ride. I'd recommend taking another elective."
9,3.0,4.0,0,0,"I would def take another elective if you can. Tests were very short and asked us about oddly specific details from the textbook or our slides, and did not represent a majority of what we learned in class."
10,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Take another higher level psyc class if you can. Exams are super short, making it hard to get an A. Final exam was hard making you memorize 18 unnecessary articles, when in reality you only need to know like 5. Very boring at the least and not worth it. There was one lecture that was interesting & it happened to be a guest lecturer, not her lecture"
11,3.0,4.0,0,0,"I was really excited about the idea of this class as I want to do something close to health psychology postgrad. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I felt like the grading criteria was oddly specific and we didn't cover much content as we focused so much on memorization. I wish I would have taken a different upper-level psychology class."
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"amazing professor, great class content! there were 4 tests and 4 papers, both relatively short and very fair! the only other grades in the class were from a few forum posts. i loved this course, can't recommend her enough!"
2,5.0,2.0,1,1,"Dr. G is a really great professor. Attendance is not mandatory, but it helps to go to class. All PowerPoints are posted online. Her tests are all short answer, but she provides a study guide with the exact questions a week before. There are two five page papers, which are graded relatively easy by the TAs. Also, there are 10 easy online assignments"
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I absolutely love Globetti. I was pretty nervous to take this class because of the Stata element, but it ended up being my favorite class. Globetti is almost always accessible outside of class and gives the best feedback of any professor I've had. She has definitely been my favorite prof at UNC "
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof Globetti is a great person and teacher. She really cares about her students and works incredible hard to make sure we all understand and get the information we need. The material is tricky, especially if your not computer savvy, but she will work with you and is great."
3,5.0,4.0,1,0,"A super caring professor. She will memorize every detail you wrote in the introduction. Professor Globetti gives amazing lectures, which are never boring. You will learn a lot from her lectures. If you don't miss the class before a holiday or a break, she will tell you the answer to the bonus question on your exams. So, don't miss her lectures!"
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Globetti is incredibly kind, and very willing to be helpful to her students. She made the most of content that was not always that exciting, and went through the material logically and efficiently."
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Globetti was probably the nicest professor I've ever had. She was incredibly accessible, would reach out to me frequently, and was always there whenever I needed help. In a course with inherently difficult content she made it easy to understand and was incredibly helpful in making sure we actually learned. Great all-around person and professor!"
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof Globetti gave extensions freely and clarified any topics covered on assignments before you turned them in. There's lots of reading but you can get by without doing it all, and she gives warnings about what's going to be on assignments/exams so you're never caught off guard. She's also just very nice/funny so her lectures are interesting!"
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,I absolutely loved having Professor Globetti this semester! She is extremely caring and wants you to do well in the class. It is important to do the readings or at least understand the content within them for the tests. Overall the class is a great introduction to political science and is good for gen-eds.
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof Globetti cares a lot about what she teaches and her students. Grading is pretty lenient, expectations are clear, and she is more than willing to help you succeed in every way possible. I would definitely recommend taking her class"
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof. Globetti is one of the kindest professors Ive ever had at unc. She genuinely cares about your well-being and will do anything she can to help you. Class consists of 2 papers, 3 exams, and class participation, but she offers a lot of extra credit."
10,5.0,3.0,0,0,"In this class, you will need to read a lot, participate, and be a decent writer to get an A. The readings are talked about in the exams, so keep up. The lectures are interesting and include current-day news. The professor cares about your grade as well so if you are struggling, make sure to ask questions."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,Dr. OG is an amazing professor and I recommend him 100000%. He is very passionate about his material and he also is very understanding and caring. 
2,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Oscar is an extremely nice human, but class is boring. You get just a week to do each lab, which is 10-15 pages of APA style writing. "
3,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Oscar gives great step-by-step explanations of the stats concepts behind labs. The class is super approachable as he gives sample code that is almost the same as what you need to do for the lab. My complaints are that there isn't enough active learning making it VERY DIFFICULT to stay awake during class, and each lab can get LONG (e.g. 13 pages)"
4,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Professor Gonzalez is great!! Learning how to use R sounds intimidating but he's super helpful and walks you step by step. Also he has a textbook on the syllabus, but it wasn't  necessary. He goes over everything in lecture and there are no exams. Pay attention to what he goes over in lecture and go back through his slides for help on assignments"
5,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Gonzalez is really nice, but his lectures are quite boring. There are no tests, but there is a group project all semester. The assignments aren't too bad, but they are time consuming. For the final, there was a final paper and a group presentation, in which both he graded super easy. "
6,4.0,3.0,1,0,Professor Gonzalez is both well-versed in psychometrics and incredibly sweet and caring. Wasn't looking forward to the class because it is stat heavy and ew math but he made it super interesting and easy to follow along with.
1,4.0,2.0,0,0,"There was a lot of reading for the class. The class was a lot of effort, considering its a 100 lvl course. The exams were based off the lectures, so take good notes and study those notes. Usually all multiple choice, around 40-50 questions. 4 exams. If you study the lectures you should be able to get A or B."
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,Such a great professor! I was actually interested in the material we learned and she was genuinely passionate about what she was teaching. Easy class to take for a gen-ed. I highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Malone Gonzalez!
3,4.0,2.0,0,0,The class is very interesting and is super easy if you've ever taken a sociology class before. There's a good amount of homework with the readings but I didn't do any of the readings and got Bs on the midterms and full credit on all homework and in-class activities. You can def half-a this class and get a good grade.
4,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Shannon was great, super sweet and provided a lot of extra credit for exams. The exams themselves were crazy easy, I didn't do a single reading, just looked at the slides before exams and came out with an A. Great soci class to knock out that gen ed. "
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,Pretty easy class for the most part. Study a little for the exams and you will do okay.
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Such an interesting and thought provoking class! There are many assignments that are based on your own experiences and analyzing your own life, which makes the course much more relatable. There's many readings, but she goes over them in class and they're generally interesting. Take her class is you can!!"
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Malone Gonzalez has been by far the best professor Ive had at UNC. There are readings to do before every class but shes very real and open to what she expects out of every student and truly wants every student to succeed in her class. She has an awesome personality and its truly a great lecturer. Exams were also pretty easy.
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof Gonzalez is really caring and actually has a personality- unlike many professors. There are only a couple exams and homeworks that make up your grade, however she is super accommodating and wants students to get A's. Definitely recommend!"
9,5.0,1.0,0,0,"This class was very interactive, we spent a lot of time in discussion groups. Gonzales was very understanding, she made our tests open note in order to combat the stress students were feeling. This class was interesting but it did not focus on what I thought it would, we talked a lot about race, sexuality, and how all these things interact."
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Straightforward class. You can either pay attention in class and briefly skim the textbook for what he didn't cover or zone out in class and read. Either way, the exams are non-cumulative and 70/30 multiple choice/short answer. MC isn't confusing and short answer has lenient grading. Dr. Gordon uses really dry humor in class but it's amusing."
2,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Gordon seems like a nice guy and he sprinkles jokes into his lectures here and there, but the content for this class felt like a slog to get through. Additionally, it felt as though it was difficult to glean information from the slides when reviewing for exams. One of the more boring courses I've had here. Take it only if you need it."
3,4.0,2.0,0,0,"He's a good professor. Very monotonous during his lectures. Never paid attention in class and got an A. As long as you do the readings and the participation assignments, you'll be fine. He's funny but the online format made it harder to wanna pay attention."
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Most of the time, I didn't know too much about what was going on in class. He gives you a study guide, and those are pretty spot on and I usually learn the material best from those and finding other resources explaining things better. The projects are fine IF you have good group members, or else they will be a PAIN."
5,2.0,2.0,0,0,Such a boring class and no clear structure for teaching (bunch of rambling). Idk if I'm just dumb but I did not really comprehend the readings or many of the concepts. I did not really go to class or sufficiently read the readings and did fine. Annoying projects but just do the assignments and you can get a good grade
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,Dr. Gordon is awesome! He is accessible outside of class and his tests are manageable if you study. Definitely recommend this professor!
7,4.0,4.0,0,0,"He's a great guy, however his tests are some of the worst I've ever taken at UNC. I had an A average for everything else, but failed both of his tests along with about half of the class. It might have been that the TA was just heartless, bc it seems as though he doesn't make his tests. Other than that, he will work with you if you need help"
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Gordon is a cool guy! I do find his class a bit typical of honors classes in the fact that they are small and grading can be a bit of mystery. Nonetheless, it was not hard to get an A in the end, but throughout the semester I was never sure if it would end up that way!"
9,5.0,2.0,0,1,My favorite professor at UNC. His lectures are very interesting and he has a good sense of humor. The exams are also fairly straightforward and easy if you study.
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,Peter Gordon is GREAT! I loved taking sensation and perception with him! He is older and has a slightly monotone voice but will still keep your attention during lecture. He has a witty sense of humor and wants to keep the class involved during participation assignments (read & discuss article). Exams are straightforward.
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Hands down one of my favorite professors and classes ever. He is so funny, personable and engaging and the material we cover is so interesting and applicable to life. I wish I could take 10 more classes with professor Gray!! Exams are pretty specific, but he gives extra credit. Not an easy A but you wont regret taking this class, 10/10 recommend"
2,5.0,3.0,4,0,"Dr. Gray is the best. He lectures every class but he actually is really engaging with his talks, I was never bored.  He is incredibly helpful and answers questions well. It was one of the best classes I've taken at Carolina and it was definitely because of Dr. Gray. His tests do have questions that you'd only know if you regularly came to class."
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"This has probably been my favorite class taken so far at UNC! Dr. Griffin cares so much about her students and the subject matter, and it shows in the lectures and projects. Exams are online and very easy as long as you take notes in class and pay attention. "
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Her lectures were really interesting and engaging! She had a fun group project that was super easy and if you put in the time and effort into the papers you could get a 100. The exams are appilcation base but taken online and open notes!! I would so take Dr,Griffin again!!"
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I can't think of many UNC professors better than Dr. Griffin! I have little interest in clinical psych, but she still made the class engaging and one of my favorites this semester. All of her tests and assignment are straight forward and easy to do well on, and they do a great job making sure the material is clear. Take a class with her if you can!"
4,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Griffin is great, interesting in lecture and at answering questions. Exams are online. Only con is that in 242 we have a project worth 36% of our grade and the grading on that is tough, due to TAs. "
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,Really wonderful professor and super understanding. Case studies are graded a little harshly depending on your TA so be aware of that since it is a large part of your grade. Lectures are very interesting and easy to be engaged! Wonderful professor!
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I love Dr. Griffin! I took 245 with her this semester and I'll be taking 242 with her next semester. She is very knowledgable and has worked in many different clinical settings so she has a lot of experience. She is also very sweet! I highly recommend taking 245 with her, it's a super interesting class and she executes very well. 5/5 quality!"
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,The absolute best professor I have ever had. Dr. Griffin is absolute BRILLIANT -- she knows exactly how to teach in way that is clear and so easy to digest. She is ORGANIZED!!! She provides clear and organized modules and have so much helpful tools for studying. Dr. Griffin is the level professors should be compared to.
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,Dr. Griffin is great! She made lectures super interesting and offered 24-hr grace periods for almost all of her assignments. She's very caring and really wants to see her students succeed! 100% recommend her for any psychology course she offers (ESPECIALLY 242!).
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Take 242 with Dr. Griffin!! She makes the material super interesting. You can tell she wants the best for her students and her class/homework just makes sense, she doesn't try to be difficult. She also brings in people to give talks which are super interesting. If you follow the rubrics and do the work, you will get an A."
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Griffin is amazing! 242 has so many components that go into final course grade. Definitely a thorough class to take if you're interested in clinical psychology (guest speakers, hands-on activities, comprehensive readings and application-based questions)"
11,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Griffin is a great lecturer, however her test can be very tricky being that it is mainly an application based test,  we had a clinical project that was 32% of our grade, the grading for that was kind of weird but if you followed the samples given it would be an easy A, overall I really recommend her!"
12,5.0,2.0,0,0,"dr. griffin is easily one of my favorite professors. she's literally the best lecturer i've ever seen, her lectures are so engaging and i genuinely loved going to this class so much. there's four case study papers (one can be dropped/skipped) but they're super easy too! midterm and final are open-note too :) take a class with her!!!"
13,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Griffin was a really nice teacher, but the grading scale for our project that determined 32% of our grade was very unfair, with everyone starting at an 85 and either getting bumped up or bumped down. Her exams were also pretty hard, nothing really prepares you for them but the second one is easier cause you'll know whats coming."
14,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Griffin is a fantastic lecturer, and she makes the content in her lessons very interesting. She is constantly being named as a great, highly-recommended professor within the UNC psych majors community. Her tests can be a bit difficult, and there is one weekly reading quiz. Reading quizzes are no problem if you skim the readings!"
15,5.0,3.0,0,0,"She's a great teacher, but she does pronounce stimuli as ""stim-you-lee"". Since the word stimuli is brought up a decent bit in the class, if that procuration bothers you, then I would not recommend taking this course. "
16,5.0,3.0,0,0,Hands down my all time favorite professor at UNC! Lectures are always very interesting and well organized! Her class never gets boring! Dr. Griffin is also very flexible with assignments by giving a 24 hour grace period for most of them! She is just a phenomenal human being and you can tell she truly cares about her students! Queen status for sure!
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,"There are no words adequate enough to express what an amazing professor Dr. Griffin is. She is at the top of her field and it is evident in her lectures. She is, without a doubt, my most favorite professor at UNC. Her kind attitude and approachable spirit makes such an impact on any student that has the pleasure of taking her class. ENROLL NOW!!!!!"
18,5.0,3.0,0,0,"MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR AT UNC!! Dr. Griffin may have a lot of assignments but the assignments are so interesting and are actually kind of fun. There is a group project throughout the semester that is more hands on but it is set up to where if you do it, it will help you succeed in the overall class. Could not recommend her enough. "
19,4.0,4.0,0,0,"I like the class overall. Very interesting topics. She is not so accommodating and understanding. Many people are 0.03%, 0.05% away from the higher letter grade and she would not care about curving. That's my only complaint. Besides that, this class is great. I just wish she cares more about students' future and well-being over grade inflation."
20,5.0,2.0,0,0,"First half of the class is about depression, second half about mania. The two largest assignments are the group presentation, and the individual paper on your group's topic which is scaffolded by smaller assignments during the semester. Exams are very fair. Dr. Griffin is a wonderful person who is always friendly and willing to answer any question!"
1,3.0,2.0,0,0,"He's not bad as a professor. Just follow the syllabus and do your homework, go take his class and you'll be fine."
2,4.0,2.0,1,0,"Professor Guo truly cares about his students. He gave us countless opportunities for review for the midterm and engages with students well in class. Lectures can be a bit boring, but it is not hard at all and he's a great guy! I'd take it again!"
3,2.0,4.0,0,0,"He is very kind. The exams are take home and he curves but I can not express how difficult they are and they are very poorly worded. Hardest take home exam of all time!

His accent is thick so its hard to understand his lectures 75% of the time but he is patient and respectful and professional. The material is interesting. DO NOT BUY THE BOOKS!"
4,3.0,2.0,0,0,"While Guang is very nice, and obviously cares about this subject a lot- this class has very few grades. The only tests are the midterm and final, which are both online and open note but there are some hard questions. However the reading notes are easy and boost your grade a decent bit. I'd recommend taking if you actually like sociology"
5,1.0,3.0,0,1,"Most manipulative, disrespectful professor at this school. The class was fairly easy and exams were curved, however even if you attend class every single day and participate generously, the entire class will get a C for participation and no, he will not tell you why. And he will be belligerent and condescending when you ask! Seriously avoid him."
6,1.0,5.0,0,0,"One of the worst classes I've ever taken. The entire time he'll try to paint the class as easy and straightforward, however that is far from the truth. You're graded on two tests practically (midterm/final) and some bs participation grade he doesn't explain to you. The tests are EXTREMELY wordy and hard. Overall terrible class in my opinion."
7,2.0,1.0,0,0,"If you need a study hall, take Soci 111 with Guang. He talks a bunch and doesn't really say a whole lot. Got so much work done in this class though. Final and midterm were pretty easy but some questions either make no sense or are about things we didn't learn. Readings could be long but a good chunk of your grade is based off reading notes Not bad"
8,2.0,3.0,0,0,"This class was awful. He makes his tests insanely hard. Even though they are open note, the questions ask about very specific topics or facts that cannot even be found in the PowerPoints. The reading notes are easy and help boost your grade, but the tests are so heavily weighted that it does not help much."
9,4.0,2.0,0,0,Really sweet guy. He's super excited about the topics evident in his lectures and the assigned readings. He really just wants his students to pass. The tests and final were open note and the answers were always in the lecture slides. I definitely would take the class again because the topics were also really interesting.
10,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Professor Guo is obviously passionate about the subject, though his lectures can get boring. The tests are open-laptop, but you need to be familiar with the readings. It's an easy class that I would recommend to anyone with a interest in genetics."
11,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Guang Guo is a really sweet man, however, his lectures contain little to no information that will be on the test. The tests are open-note but the questions are extremely specific."
12,2.0,4.0,1,0,"Mr. Guo was a really nice guy, but his class was messed up. He often repeats things that don't need to be repeated and his answers never actually answer your questions. He claims that the midterm and the final are easy, but they are insanely hard, even though it's open everything (and I studied hard). It was a miracle that I got an A."
13,3.0,3.0,0,0,"I actually enjoyed Prof. Guos class! Though his lectures were a bit everywhere, he was very kind after class and obviously wants us to pass. The tests given are a bit difficult, but other grades given help balance that out. Overall, hes a nice guy, though I can see why people find the class a bit boring. An easy A if you do whats needed."
14,1.0,3.0,1,0,"If you asked me what this class was about I couldn't tell you. The second half of this class was reading random articles (half of them were his own). The class was a joke, we all just did nothing because he couldn't teach us anything. And the tests are on random facts that he said during class that a lot of the times had nothing to do with class."
15,3.0,1.0,1,0,"He spends class talking about powerpoints and having students give presentations. The reading/ homework was easy and usually took less than an hour. He does not have many grades (only 5 things), so tests are important but tend to be open note. Overall, it was an easy class for my first semester of college."
16,1.0,5.0,2,1,"Freshmen, beware! The seminar is basically just reading papers. In class Dr. Guo clicks between a few ppts and says a lot while saying nothing. The grade is based on three exams which make no sense. He is not understanding of test errors and refuses to see that his questions are horrible. I've learned nothing and am so stressed about my grade."
17,2.0,5.0,2,0,"Class is basically a student presenting homework, which is an extremely long and technical research paper. A majority of the grade is the midterm and final, both of which are extremely difficult. He makes the answer choices all the same, and manages to have grammatical errors everywhere. This was harder than MATH 231 or CHEM 102. I do not recommend"
18,3.5,2.0,3,1,"He tries ot make the class interesting but by the end of the semester I got so sick of hearing about his Princeton days + ivy league rankings. I had to restrain myself from saying ""go and teach at Princeton, then!...but I didn't"
1,4.0,4.0,1,0,"I really liked Dr. Hargrove and I enjoyed the lectures a lot. I thought the content was super interesting. However, I was not prepared for the difficulty level; I did poorly on the exams despite how hard I would study, and I found the final project to be really difficult. There's 2 midterms and a final exam as well as a final group project"
2,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Hargrove is a super sweet lady. Lessons were very discussion based, it is important to take notes on what she says more than the slides. You do a group project for most of the semester which sucks if you have a bad group. Tests weren't too bad 15mc, 2 short ended, and an essay normally. TA does all the grading but ours was super nice."
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I LOVE professor Hargrove and I don't understand why she has such low ratings. The class is literally so easy as long as you show up, you don't even really need to do the readings for the class to do well. She is sweet, so accommodating, understanding, and tries her hardest to make class interesting. "
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Definitely a good amount of reading but Professor Hargrove made this class one of my all time favorites at UNC. Her lectures were interesting, informative, and she is incredibly inclusive. We talked about important topics but Professor Hargrove made everyone feel safe to share opinions or have their voice heard. 10/10 professor."
5,3.0,3.0,0,0,"This class is harder than a typical soci class (still not hard) and Hargrove takes such interesting material and makes it boring. All you do is read papers and write (forum posts, reading memos, semester long paper) and you don't really feel like you learned anything. She is nice and caring, I just think she could revamp the structure of the class"
6,4.0,3.0,0,0,"I have Hargrove for 422 & 469. She's very reasonable. I like that she makes an effort to learn everyone's name. Both classes have a semester-long project that she chunks up into mini assignments. Lectures aren't bad bc she breaks it up w/ discussion, videos, and activities. Tests for 469 are hard for a SOCI class, but fine if you just study"
7,1.0,4.0,1,0,"there's a reason why Hargrove has so many bad reviews. she doesn't know how to teach. she reads off lecture slides and forces students to participate. the content of the course is extremely boring and outdated. you can tell she's had little to no pedagogical training. avoid taking her at all costs. not a fair grader at all, and i made an A."
8,2.0,3.0,1,0,Exams aren't hard if you go to class. Readings are outdated and dull. Lectures are boring and she calls on people if she doesn't get enough participation which is annoying. Little to no feedback on any of the assignments except for the midterm. For a class about mental health she didn't really seem to care about ours
9,3.0,3.0,3,2,"Hargrove has a lot of awful reviews. Her lecture isn't entirely productive & you do have to be in class most of the time, but the material is common sense. She's a bit dry, along with the material. But don't be scared of this class. Her tests are fair, and I got by without reading except to clarify. It's not as awful as her reviews make it seem."
10,1.0,3.0,4,1,"I wanted a fairly easy class, but hargrove does not make it easy to get an A. She gives next to 0 feedback and isn't helpful during office hours. I had a tragic family event happen this semester and she was not understanding at all. Unless you are a 2nd semester senior and this is a mandatory class, don't take it with her! !"
11,5.0,3.0,4,3,"I really enjoyed Dr. Hargrove's class! The lecture material was interesting and I felt I learned a lot in her class environment. I particularly enjoyed the panel about mental health in the criminal justice system. Also, we watched Silver Linings Playbook in class which was a nice break during a hard week (Bradley Cooper also helped) She cares a lot"
12,5.0,4.0,4,3,"Love Dr. Hargrove -- one of the most well-spoken and inspirational profs i have had at UNC. Doesn't give much feedback on assignments but isn't a particularly hard grader. Assignments are a midterm, four 2-3 page reading responses, and a big term paper split into a bunch of different parts. highly recommend if you're interested in psychology"
13,3.0,2.0,0,2,"she was alright - the class was more boring than i anticipated but it was easy. i got away with not doing the readings until skimming them the night before the exam. she's not clear about what's on her exams (she says ""it's all important""), but they're mostly based off her powerpoint slides which she posts online. fine for a gen ed, but boring"
14,1.0,3.0,1,4,"made what should have been such an interesting class so awful and boring. did not care about students learning the material or valuing their additions to discussion. no feedback on any assignments throughout the semester besides ""met the requirements."" tough grader without much feedback or leeway"
15,1.0,4.0,2,2,"I felt that Dr. Hargrove didn't really care about her students, whether or not they learned the material, or teaching the course. She was really unfriendly and lectured right off the slides despite assigning tons of reading. This class should have been really interesting, but she made it incredibly boring."
16,2.0,3.0,3,3,"Dr. Hargrove is nice but she could make the class a lot more interesting and engaging. Heavy readings which don't really matter, so just don't waste your time. Exams will come from lectures. Annoying final project. Overall not a stressful class but not an ""easy A"""
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Harrison is an outstanding professor who truly cares about all of his students. I took this class during Summer Session I and even though the class was fast paced, he made all of the lessons accessible and easy to comprehend. He is also great at dedicating time to prepare us for exams and to review content/assignments."
2,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Loved Professor Harrison as a human -- super caring and understands most students are just there for psyc major credit. Makes content as interesting as possible, but his slides are very hard to understand if you don't pay attention to every second of lecture... Exams are hard but fair, and assignments help reinforce what's taught in lecture."
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,Highly recommend taking Professor Harrison for PSYC 210. The assignments & quizzes are straightforward and he provides clear rubrics for how he grades. A caring professor that wants his students to learn and succeed! Took this class online over the summer but definitely a class that you can do well in by showing up and completing assignments. 
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,Work is fairly easy if you go to class and listen in class. All the answers for the assignments are mentioned in class and he has a tutorial video for each assignment. I got a B because I barely went to class and got average grades on the assignments. 
5,5.0,1.0,0,0,Dr. Harrison is very caring and wants the best for you to succeed in his class. You need to pay for an website called packback for the class but the assignments on it are very easy and can be completed in 15 min or less. Dr. Harrison is very helpful and allowed me to gain partial credit when I missed an assignment. 
6,5.0,1.0,0,0,"This was my first class with Dr. Harrison (online Summer) and I will definitely be recommending him to others and taking his classes again! He wants his students to succeed, and is passionate about his work. He responds quickly to emails, and is always willing to answers questions. He is by far the best professor I have had at UNC thus far. "
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Harrison is the best professor I've ever had the pleasure of taking a class with. He genuinely wants his students to succeed and he gives great lectures. Everything was open note so if you take good notes in class, the tests are not too difficult. He always responds to emails, even at midnight."
8,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Midterm and final were kind of hard. Try to get old midterms from a friend to practice. Otherwise, moderate work load. Not the easiest class by any means, but take Harrison. Good guy."
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Patrick Harrison is the most caring, kind, and warmhearted professor I have had a chance to encounter at UNC.  He is also an amazing lecturer :) "
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Harrison is an amazing professor who made the course paper manageable! He actually cares about students' mental health and well-being. Plenty of extra credit opportunities were provided, and deadlines were extended for students to make his class more convenient. Lectures were funny and inspiring, which was needed for the late afternoon. "
11,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Harrison is the nicest and most caring professor I've ever met. He is accessible outside of class. The class is based on one research paper (~20-30pgs); The paper has separate deadlines throughout the year, so it's bearable. Come to class! Participation is the only factor that could've made my A- to an A. I had a B+, and he rounded me to an A-!"
12,5.0,1.0,0,0,A very caring teacher than knowledges the stresses of college students so he is super considerate
13,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Amazing professor and overall person! Super kind, funny, and passionate about what he teaches. We need more like him at UNC. Very responsive to emails and flexible. "
14,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Truly one of a kind. UNC has a gem by having him teach here. He is so caring and truly respects and worried about all his students. He is funny and understand that you are not only a student, but a person as well. 10/10 recommend! Favorite professor at UNC!"
15,5.0,1.0,0,0,This is hands down the best professor at UNC. He truly cares about his students and allows flexibility with deadlines in an effort to allow his students to actually learn things. He will help you in any way he can! Take as many of his classes as you can.
16,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Nicest professor I have ever seen. Tries to present statistics in a very digestible way. However, class can be extremely slow. Additionally concepts are presented in such a general way that it causes it to mush with all of the other concepts we learned previously. This leads to things being more confusing than it needs to be. But overall easy class"
17,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I could not recommend Dr. Harrison enough. If I could take any class with him again, I would 100% would. He is so kind and he really cares about his students and their well-being.  Dr. Harrison is genuinely such a caring person and he keeps lectures interesting.  You can make memes for extra credit in his class.  Take him if you can!!"
18,3.0,2.0,1,1,"Harrison is an awesome person, but I just want to warn that, at least in his Psych 210 class, you will succeed mostly if you are an auditory learner. Slides don't really contain any information that is helpful when it's exam time. He tries to assist outside of class, but if you can't process lots of information auditory, get ready for a battle. "
19,5.0,2.0,0,0,"one of the best professors at UNC! I had him for both psyc210 and psyc270 and still use what he taught me. I highly recommend a class with Patrick, it's an easy A as long as you participate"
20,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I took Harrison for PSYC210 last fall and my choice to take him again for PSYC270 this fall was one of the best choices I have made at UNC. Dr. Harrison is kind, caring, and one of the best professors I've ever had at UNC. The material in this class is difficult but with Dr. Harrison it's manageable"
1,5.0,3.0,1,0,"She really cares about seeing her students succeed and really wants us to learn. Her grading was totally realistic, I always knew exactly what was expected of me and we had really great discussions in this class. She's so knowledgeable and fun to learn from altogether. One of my favorites."
1,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Prof. Hartlyn is a top dog when it comes to Latin American Political Science. This class is personalized for first-years, making it accessible and educational. Sometimes the lectures seem a little dense, but if you take this class, you will emerge with a good understanding of history, politics, and culture in Latin America."
2,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Hartlyn's class covers a lot of material, but he goes above and beyond to make himself available if you need extra help at any time and he is super kind. It is not an easy A- there are 2 exams, 10 pg paper, and group presentation which count for a lot of your grade, but the material is interesting particularly if you are studying Latin America."
3,2.0,4.0,0,0,"He really knew what he was talking about and was enthusiastic about the subject, but really painful to watch speak for over an hour. I ended up taking no notes and not learning much."
4,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Definitely think this class is better in person not online. Prof. was accommodating for me & seems to really care for us. But, there is a lot of info in this class & presented on not really organized slides. I would take this class again in person, but not online. Wait it out for in person classes imo. There is also a group project & final paper."
5,3.0,4.0,0,0,"BEWARE: Don't take this online. Quizzes, assignments assigned mid-week due 5pm Friday (sometimes in groups), group work (powerpoint), news reports. Hard exams (so much material is covered), lots of readings. Prof gave little accommodation; I suspect essay ext. was because of huge demand. Wait out COVID-19; you'll learn more, hate this class less."
6,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Hartlyn is incredibly knowledgeable. It is clear that he really knows his stuff. The class is super interesting and I really learned a lot. You can't just breeze by in this class, you will have to put in the effort to do well, but Prof. Hartlyn really cares about his students and wants to see you succeed."
7,5.0,4.0,0,0,"It is the class that you have to take if you want to learn about Latin America. Dr Hartlyn is great man and professor, always support me outside of class in my research and give very useful feedback."
8,5.0,3.0,2,0,"I went to Professor Hartlyn for help on a paper on Colombia this semester and I'm not even currently in his class. He has written and experienced so much on Latin America his input is invaluable, he hooked me up with all kinds of people, books, and articles in about 30 minutes. He (and profs like him) are the reason UNC is worth attending."
9,3.0,4.0,1,0,"He's a good teacher, but DON'T TAKE HIS FYS. He teaches what are meant to be easy classes as if they're 400-level courses (what he's used to teaching). There's a term paper, group project, readings, midterms, and a final. He's a great guy, but this is not an easy-A. If you're interested in the subject and don't mind the hard work, then go ahead."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Hetherington's lectures were always funny, informative, and each class doesn't cover too much content. You're fine as long as you take notes, as he doesn't post lecture notes or powerpoints at all. Tests were a bit harder than expected, but they're curved. Not too difficult a class, but still harder than 100 level classes usually are. "
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Hetherington is an excellent professor. His lectures are engaging and informative, and made POLI 100 a fun class to go to. He is very funny and his lectures are helpful, take notes. 2 papers, 3 exams are most your grade + recitation, show up, listen, take notes and you'll enjoy this class and get a good grade."
3,3.0,4.0,0,0,"This class was a LOT harder than expected. The reviews here really fooled me. He's super nice and very funny, but the lectures were boring, he speaks really fast and provides no notes, review sheets, or lecture content. The tests were much harder than they needed to be. "
4,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Hetherington is great! He is so funny and entertaining in his lectures. Attendance is not mandatory, and he often does a little recap of the previous class at the beginning of the next class. There are textbooks but he uploads one of them onto Sakai. No slides during lectures but works well. 2 exams + final and 2-3 papers"
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof. Hetherington is super nice and really funny. The lectures were boring but he did everything he could to make them not terrible. The reading is A LOT, but the exams aren't super reading-based. He doesn't take attendance, but you definitely need to go because the lectures aren't recorded and he says a lot of important stuff. "
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Cannot say enough nice things about Marc! By far the best professor I've had at UNC and I will be checking every semester to take one of his classes again. He's hilarious, engaging, passionate, knowledgeable, and just has such great energy. The course was graded on 3 exams and 2 essays which he prepares you well for. Can't recommend him enough!"
7,5.0,2.0,1,0,Marc Hetherington is the absolute GOAT. legit the funniest guy I know. Makes lectures super interesting and fun (we had a t-shirt toss one time). Best professor at UNC hands down
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Just a great teacher, loved the class, entertaining. Gives textbooks but they aren't heavily focused upon."
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Maybe the best professor I've had at UNC. Endlessly kind & caring. Knowledgeable about the material & great at communicating it. We were only graded by 2 exams and a 10 page paper, but there was a lot of flexibility both in terms of what we could write and when we could turn it in. I wish more professors here shared his cheerfulness and compassion."
10,5.0,1.0,0,0,"All you have to do is take good notes during lecture/recitation and you're good. The information covered in lectures tends to be extremely boring. HOWEVER, Marc is such a naturally funny person that everyone stays engaged. During the course of the whole semester you're only graded by two papers and a few tests. Take this class!!"
11,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Heatherington brought a great joy to lectures with jokes and funny stories, you can really tell that he cares about his students. Grading is made up of 2 papers and 3 exams, however the exam questions are released ahead of time. Overall, I would highly recommend."
12,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Oh, where to start with professor Hetherington. Marc is truly the most fun and laid back professor I've had at UNC. His lectures are very informal, but if you pay attention you will learn a lot. There were only like 5 assignments for the whole semester, and the grading on them was lenient. Would 100% recommend taking his class."
13,5.0,2.0,1,0,"I cannot say enough good things about Hetherington. One of the most genuine and caring profs Ive ever had at UNC. Class was enjoyable and not stressful at all. Talks alot about things that matter in regards to polarization, very interesting and relevant lectures. Take his class you wont regret it!!"
14,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Hetherington is so funny and likable! You aren't graded by much, but the TAs grading seem to be fairly easy. Attendance wasn't mandatory, but you should go because he'll drop hints of what tests will be like. I loved his sport jacket collection!"
15,5.0,2.0,0,0,Easiest class I've taken thus far. There are only a few assignments in the entire class. The only thing you really have to do is attend lectures and take notes. The lectures are always very amusing too!
16,5.0,1.0,0,0,I honestly just signed up for this class to fill hours but I am so happy that I did. Prof Hetherington is seriously the best and the most understanding. A funny guy that gives engaging lectures. Highly recommend!!
17,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Hetherington is a true GEM in the department! Not only is he a super amazing professor who takes the time to thoroughly explain complicated aspects of government and governmental processes, but he also is such a kind and understanding professor, especially with this class being virtual during this pandemic. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM!"
18,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof. Hetherington is really funny, charismatic, and understanding. I really appreciated how he had us read and discuss both Democratic and Republican materials and how casually he handled class discussion. He's an amazing teacher."
19,5.0,3.0,0,0,Awesome professor. Lectures were interesting and asynchronous. He connects class material to current events which helps to keep things relevant. Overall there were 2 papers and maybe 3 exams(dont quite remember) but all of which were very easy since he gave exam prompts ahead or time. Easy A if you attend lectures and recitations.
20,5.0,2.0,0,0,Marc is such a likable guy. He did his class asynchronous with a live class option. He also gives out exam questions before the exam which was so helpful. He centered the material around what was going on currently which really helped me understand a crazy year in politics lol.
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Hooghe is one of the most brilliant and inspiring professors at UNC. I took POLI 433 as a first-year and was slightly apprehensive due to my lack of prior knowledge regarding the EU, but her lectures progressed in depth and were comprehensible throughout. One piece of advice- take part in the Oxford Union Debate- such a fun experience!"
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Liesbet is an excellent professor and pioneer in her field, which makes her work incredibly cerebral. The discussion in class is also extremely informative, however, if you do not have an interest in multilevel governance or the EU/IO's then this might not be your class. I would take just to meet professor Hooghe however."
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Hooghe was truly one of the kindest professors I have ever met. She was understanding of my mental health issues and supported me throughout the whole semester. Her class is extremely interesting, has great lectures, and contains a few, important assignments. Shes a gem! 10/10 I would recommend a class with her."
4,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Hooghe is an excellent professor. She cares a lot about her students understanding the material than being able to regurgitate it on a test. There are only a handful of grades. The class will seem dry in the beginning, but closer towards the end of the semester she becomes more fun and gets to know her students better."
5,4.0,3.0,1,0,"This class is very interesting if you want to understand multilevel governance. However, as a rather novel concept, the class is very experimental. While the grading criteria is clear, Hooghe changes due dates and assignments to be more fitting to students. She is very flexible. Sometimes her lectures are tangential, but she is very knowledgeable."
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I love Professor Hooghe! She does not always stay on topic, but her lectures are always interesting. She always posts her slides, so if you know that information, you will be set. Not many grades, but graded fairly. Very available, and always willing to help and clarify, or just chat about projects, ideas, or thoughts involving Europe or the EU."
7,3.0,1.0,2,0,"There were only 4 grades in this class (midterm, final and 2 in class activities) so if you mess one up it can be hard to catch up. However, she literally shows you the questions that are going to be on the test beforehand, so if you are willing to make a minimal effort you will get an A"
8,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Hooghe is so intelligent and loves to talk about everything political science. I took her for my freshmen seminar and she was really great. We only did easy work as it was a first year class, but great overall class and relatively easy. I would definitely recommend her as she has so many accolades and was very accessible outside of class!"
9,2.0,4.0,0,1,Dr. Hooghe is a bit spacy and she talks about whatever subject she feels like talking about instead of what she's going to test on. Make sure you get a good TA if you take her. Recitation is your only chance to learn what you need for the exams. The TAs also grade the exams and some grade significantly harder than others so beware.
10,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Having a good TA is key - go to the class, do the readings and you will be FINE.  I like her - she def. knows what she's talking about!!!"
11,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Dull lectures with a monotone voice.  Does not know how to use a microphone.  Tests are not that bad, but everything is graded by your T.A.  If you have a tough T.A. you're screwed."
12,2.5,3.0,0,0,"Boring class...most people either fall asleep or play cards on their computer. Make sure you get a good TA for this class, they will be the only ones you actually learn anything from"
13,3.5,3.0,0,0,"A fairly interesting teacher with a neat accent.  Lectures are decent and attendance isn't mandatory but there is not textbook and no posting of the notes, so it's pretty important to come.  Tests aren't that difficult.  The main thing is to find a decent TA.  Overall a pretty interesting class, I would recommend it."
14,2.5,4.0,0,0,No Comments
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Not sure why Dr. Hopfinger has such a low rating tbh. Super understanding during a crazy term(FA21). Straightforward material. Available after class for questions, encourages discussion in lecture. Only con is he doesn't post lecture slides before class + u cant watch recorded lectures w/out an excuse. Lecture is fast but engaging. Def type notes!!"
2,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Don't get too discouraged by the reviewers! He's not bad, but you definitely do have to work for your grade. If he tells you to read something specific in the textbook, read it! Exams are very content/lecture heavy, readings heavy (but only what he specifies so it's not too bad), so give yourself some time ahead to prepare. He speaks fast too."
3,1.0,3.0,0,0,"Exams are a bit tough, professor is not lenient or funny."
4,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Hopfinger is definitely more of a researcher than a professor. His class is super dense and the information can be confusing at times. He lectures fast and asks very specific questions on exams based on minute details of lectures. You definitely have to put in the work but he's not the worst, he means well and tries to be entertaining."
5,3.0,4.0,0,0,"I did not do so great on the first exam but once I started putting in the work my grades have definitely improved. You have to attend class and don't even bother trying to write out your notes because he talks very fast. Be prepared to remember lots of material. Not the easiest class, but he is helpful, and I found it interesting at least!"
6,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Ok, so... don't take this class with him. Lectures using a powerpoint and says so much while also saying nothing at all while speaking very quickly. 70% of final grade is based on 3 exams that comprise of details he mentioned while lecturing, but aren't in the powerpoint, so you either take really good notes or you fail. Not worth it."
7,2.0,4.0,0,0,"VERY lecture heavy, goes very fast in class. instructions are rarely clear. 3 exams throughout the semester that make up 300 of your 400 possible points. two 5 page papers on very boring articles."
8,3.0,4.0,0,0,"He moves quickly through lectures, doesn't post them, and 90% of exam material came from those lectures. Perfectly nice guy that is open to help at office hours, but this class certainly is one of the harder courses I've taken in the psyc major."
9,3.0,4.0,0,0,This class is super lecture heavy and he lectures for almost the entire period without stopping. He doesn't post the slides so get ready to type really fast. Tests are hard and have both MC and short response and are worth a lot of your grade. The class isn't too much work on a day to day basis but you really need to prepare for exams.
10,2.0,5.0,0,0,Very nice person but tough in grading. I won't suggest taking NSCI 434 with him.
11,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Hopfinger was a perfectly nice professor, but lectures moved too quickly to comprehend what was being said. Textbook readings did not line up with lectures and powerpoints were not posted online, which made studying difficult. Exam grades did not reflect my understanding. Though not the hardest class I've taken, I would not recommend this class."
12,3.0,4.0,1,1,"Hopfinger is a great person with an obvious passion for cognitive psychology, however, his refusal to post power points online and his material dense lectures make this course strenuous. Additionally, you'll only have a total of 400 achievable points in a semester, so study hard for tests."
13,2.0,4.0,2,0,"I took his first year seminar class thinking it was going to be extremely interesting. Wrong. The FYS on Brain Plasticity was basically a book club. There are 2 required books that you have to purchase and read. You have to write a 3 big ideas and 1 thought ""paper"" on essentially every chapter in the books. There are also long scientific ""articles"""
14,1.0,5.0,1,1,Never worked so hard to get such bad grades in a psychology class
15,2.5,5.0,0,0,"Powerpoint lectures are not available online. The TAs are really tough graders (and the only ones who actually grade your material). Dr. Hopfinger goes way too fast during lecture, and for some people, it's very difficult to meet with a professor after class to look at certain slides."
16,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Dr. Hopfinger is a good lecturer, though at times he goes too fast for those who take notes by hand. All his powerpoints are online and he makes an effort to engage his students. We had five 2-page papers that were hell; few people got full points on them. A few voicethreads and discussion days for participation. B's are very common, A's are rare."
17,5.0,2.0,1,0,Good lecturer. Definitely there to help you. Fairly easy class. Several 1 page research review papers. A presentation. A midterm and a non-cumulative final. He's somewhat boring but a very nice guy.  
1,3.0,4.0,0,0,"We had a lot of work since she re-used recorded lectures from last semester on top of the long readings. The readings also sometimes didn't feel applicable to class, more just a tour of her research background. But she's nice and very knowledgable about the material, even if class discussions weren't the most interesting."
2,2.0,3.0,0,0,"Really sweet lady and incredibly smart. She was always very helpful and graded assignments pretty easily. That said, she did assign about 60 pages of heavy reading along with an asynchronous lecture before every class. Also a 10 page research paper wasn't fun. Might be better in person but just a crazy amount of work."
3,3.0,4.0,0,0,"She never really taught anything in class. She assigns a ton of unnecessary reading plus long lectures to watch before then just places us into breakout rooms that are a waste of time for half of class for us to discuss her ""Powerpoints."" She's nice and clearly smart about the subject, but very stats. heavy & boring. I would try a diff. Latin prof."
4,5.0,4.0,0,0,"A lot of the work lies in processing the information and learning how to do research. You're don't need to worry about years and dates, focus on causes and effects and really digging into them. Sometimes she expects familiarity with things that you might be unaware of, or you might not understand her accent, but she's great when you ask questions!"
5,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Taking Prof. Huber's PhD class as an undergrad this semester. She is charismatic, elegant, and enthusiastic towards her field, yet super humorous and down-to-earth! Really inspired by her!"
6,5.0,1.0,1,0,"Huber may be difficult in lower level courses, but she's great as the POLI Honors prof. If you're considering the POLI Honors sequence, don't let these other reviews sway you-- she's amazing and very laid back in 691H. I don't think anyone received less than an A-."
7,5.0,3.0,1,0,"She gives good feedback and is clear with what she wants to be done. She's open to reworking stuff because she isn't giving feedback to be rude, but because she wants improvement and the best from her students. She's nice, too. She brought paper to class one day because we mainly use computers and it was so sweet i love her"
8,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Very unclear grading. I was consistently told  I was performing well in the course, and then given a grade much lower than what was expected. Many of my peers have experienced the same issue. Lectures are awful and difficult to follow. The TAs are extremely helpful in clarifying, but the prof herself just doesn't know how to teach."
9,3.0,3.0,0,0,"This class taught me a lot and I would recommend it to other POLI majors. However, the way she grades is extremely unclear, no one really knows the point system except for her. Her TA (Guzel) was AMAZING. The actual lectures are hard to follow because they're kind of all over the place, but Guzel really helps to clear everything up in recitation!"
10,3.5,3.0,0,0,"The course requires a comprehensive knowledge of Latin American politics to be successful on the midterm and final. Huber is really helpful when it comes to preparing for the midterm/final, but she can tend to be dry during lectures. She puts all her Powerpoints online, so it's not completely necessary to read the book, although it's helpful."
11,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Huber is definitely an expert at Contemporary Latin American Politics, but she has problems conveying her knowledge to the students. This exams are essay based and pretty comprehensive, but not too difficult if you come to class and go to recitation. Grade consists of Mid Term, Final, Research Paper, and Recitation participation."
12,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Interesting course material, but Professor Huber tends to be dry.  She does not allow laptops and lectures from a powerpoint every class.  The exams are somewhat detailed but not difficult if you come to lecture and pay attention.  She does grade on a curve, based on how the TA's grade you.  I would recommend this course only to POLI majors."
13,3.5,4.0,0,0,"Pros: She is clearly an expert in her field and is good at explaining things. Cons: Lectures could get kind of boring and we couldn't use laptops, which made it challenging to take notes because she talks kind of fast. Overall, this class is difficult but I would still recommend her as a professor."
14,1.0,5.0,0,1,Avoid at all costs.
15,4.0,4.0,0,0,"She was a good Prof.  The class could get pretty boring, but she tried.  She is most def one of those people that would probably do better in a small class.  The exams and pop quizzes are that hard as long as you do the reading.  The amount of reading does suck."
16,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Latin American Politics - pretty boring class, questions on tests asked for minute details which you probably wouldn't think were that important in the readings.  She grades really hard, as well...I didn't really like this class at all"
17,1.5,5.0,0,3,"I can't remember the exact number of this class since courses changed, but it was Latin American Politics.  She is the worse teacher probably in the Poli Sci Dept. She's a complete communist... Everything wrong in Latin America is the CIA's fault according to her- no detail into economics of the turmoilous political climate.  Hard and worthless!"
18,3.0,4.0,0,0,"If you are interested in Latin American politics you will do alright, but if not- there is little she does to get you interested.  It is also a lot of reading and mid terms/ final is in class essay so you really have to know your stuff."
19,2.0,4.0,0,0,"So incredibly boring, does little to engage the class, I fall asleep almost every time"
20,1.5,5.0,0,0,The only class I've ever fallen asleep in
1,5.0,1.0,0,0,"100% of your grade is composed of exams, but they are extremely easy. I think you could get by with an A on the exams by just guessing. If you listen to his lectures, which he records, you're good to go. You don't really need to do the readings. Attendance wasn't required and since the slides were uploaded and class was recorded, it was nice."
2,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Professor Hummer is the sweetest human to walk the Earth. His class is based on four exams, and if you use the study guides provided, you will do well. He truly cares about his students and is super passionate about what he teaches. He is very knowledgable, and you honestly learn a lot via readings, lectures, and exams. Amazing guy!"
3,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Easiest class I've taken here. You are graded on 4 exams that honestly you could get an A in without having gone to class. I skipped every class, used online quizlets to study and got an A. Despite this, I still learned a ton because of how he formats the exams (he makes the right answer obvious so you learn as youre taking the test. "
4,5.0,1.0,0,0,Could not recommend this class more. Graded by 3 tests and a final. Test are easy if you pay attention in class and complete the study guides. He looks at your improvement in the class and decides your final grade himself. 
5,5.0,1.0,0,0,Great class and a great professor!
6,5.0,1.0,0,0,I love this man; he is clearly passionate about population health and is very caring. I would definitely take his class again.
7,5.0,1.0,0,0,Robert Hummer is an amazing guy and the course is not difficult at all. Make sure to do the study guides because every term you see on the study guide will be on the exam! This class was quite easy and very insightful. Take this class!!!! 
8,5.0,1.0,0,0,Great class. Final grade is based on 3 easy exams. As long as you pay attention and have some kind of common sense you'll be fine.
9,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Hummer is such a sweetheart! His lectures are engaging, and he made me more interested in the content than I already was. The class is based on 3 tests and a final, but the questions are easy as long as you pay attention in class and give the readings a brief skim! He and the TAs are very understanding in regards to making up exams. "
10,5.0,1.0,0,0,Amazing Professor! Very stress-free and no homework! Just three easy exams and he helps you prepare for them! I've learned a lot just by attending his lectures but attendance isn't required. He's very passionate about his work and it's appreciated. One of my favorite professors for sure!
11,5.0,1.0,0,0,fantastic prof and makes the class super easy but also very informational
12,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Robert was so adorable, every class he would tell us about his dog, whom he named B- (he gives you the back story lol). He is super passionate about public health and REALLY respected in the field so it was a cool opportunity to learn from him. The grade is made up of only four exams, which seems scary but he gives you a study guide for each exam. "
13,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Hummer was great! Lectures were recorded, no participation, lecture content was interesting. Only grades are the tests, so as long as you do a bit of studying with the study guide, you should be all set. Most of it is pretty self-explanatory. Readings aren't mandatory but were helpful in knowing test content."
14,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr Hummer is very knowledgeable in his field and cares a lot about his students. Class is very easy, graded on 3 multiple choice exams and final. He puts lots of gimme questions in the exam and posts a study guide. No assignments and you don't really need to do the reading either. If you have a tough schedule and need an easy A gen ed this is it! "
15,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Easiest class I have ever taken in my life. Requires 0 attendance, but Dr. Hummer is super sweet so you should go anyway. Exams are the only grade and are incredibly straightforward and easy. "
16,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Hummer designed the readings with students in mind, so the readings were very informative, yet only took 15 minutes at most to go through. While class does get boring at times, the exams are probably the most straightforward and forgiving I've had in my entire life. I'm now minoring in Health and Society. Highly recommended as a gen ed!"
17,5.0,1.0,0,0,Hummer is very nice but can be boring at times as he is passionate and likes to ramble. Graded by 4 test but if u read his book and look over the slides/study guides he gives you then you will be fine.
18,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Professor Hummer is the kindest professor I have had at UNC, and his lectures are both interesting and easy to follow. Your whole grade is 4 exams, but the exams are incredibly simple with lots of gimme questions. I highly recommend taking this course!"
19,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Your grade is determined by four exams.   The exams are really easy though, and he gives sample questions and potential test topics. He's a very knowledgeable, passionate, and enthusiastic person when it comes to Public Health. "
20,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Graded on 3 midterms and the final, each 25% of the grade and 50 MC questions. Lectures reflected the reading and were only boring because he has a very monotonous voice. If you read his book as assigned (not hard) and go to lectures, you should do fine in this course. Definitely sparked my interest in SOCI, and now I'm minoring in health&society!"
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Hussong is one of the most genuine professors at this university. She provides a level of flexibility for her students that shows she really cares about what is going on outside of class. Most assignments are easy, the lectures are repeating the textbook chapter so just read at some point. Exams were a bit hard so be sure to do the study guides"
2,5.0,4.0,0,0,"I absolutely adore her. She's wickedly smart, loves her work, and is dedicated to making sure her students understand the ""why"" rather than the ""what"" of psychological research."
3,4.5,2.0,0,0,Really helpful professor and very nice person.
1,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Jenkins is a nice person and lecturer; you could tell he was passionate about his work. However, this did lead to him going off on tangents sometimes. Class was easy and we had very few graded work but he did not give us our grades. I only knew that I ended up with an A. "
2,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Jenkins is a nice guy and has a great personality. The class wasnt hard, he assigned long readings for class but if you skimmed them you were totally fine as he never gave any tests or quizzes. We watched documentaries and wrote short reaction papers for our grades. However, we never actually got grades back on them but I still ended up with an A."
3,3.0,1.0,0,0,"Professor Jenkins is a good professor. However, he never graded any of our many reaction papers except our first one from the beginning of the semester. Due to this, I never knew what grade I had, in fact, for our final project I never got my grade back. "
4,4.0,4.0,0,0,Jenkins is a great person and willing to help a lot outside of class and very quick to respond to emails. Class was very information-dense and quizzes were tough. You can get away without reading the textbook as long as you study his lecture notes and go to class. Not my favorite class content-wise but great professor!
5,4.0,2.0,0,0,Jenkins is a pretty good professor and all-around was understanding and accommodating this semester. I didn't do the readings but if you pay attention in class you will be fine. Did not receive much feedback for assignments but he was an easy grader and moved our final online. I enjoyed this class and would definitely take another with Jenkins!
6,2.0,4.0,0,0,"He is nice and if you go to office hours he will help you. But, he is an incredibly hard grader and his tests are very difficult too. His lectures are also the most boring lectures that I have ever attended, so I could not understand the course material. His class also has very little structure and he gives study guides almost the night before."
7,2.0,4.0,0,0,Basically reads from the textbook the entire class. Takes attendance every day. Words questions for quizzes and tests poorly. Confusing with directions. Boring but nice (but he has to be right)
8,2.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Jenkins is a really nice guy. It's not impossible to get a good grade, its just the most boring and draining class I have ever taken at UNC. He lectures at monotone for the entire period and reads off of a word document. The class is not about thinking critically about international organizations its about memorizing basic facts & dates."
9,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Jenkins is a super nice guy and someone I think would be fun to talk to over coffee, but his lectures were incredibly boring. Especially online, it's important to make the material engaging and he hasn't done that so far. However, he's super knowledgeable and a great resource if you're interested in international politics."
10,3.0,3.0,0,0,"The topic of the class wasn't interesting to me, but Prof Jenkins was really passionate about the material so it made it bearable. He expects you to participate every day, so speak up or your participation grade will take a hit. There were small quizzes every few weeks and then a final. As well as an easy group project. I never did the readings btw"
11,3.0,4.0,0,0,Overall a nice guy but very judgemental if you don't immediately understand the material. Does not give off nice vibes. Very uppity. He likes to assert his knowledge on a topic even when its not needed.
12,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Jenkins is not only one of the best professors at Carolina, he is one of the best people. Dr. J has a treasure trove of knowledge if you are willing to attend lectures and listen. Always accessible and a fair grader who will give you good feedback/make clear expectations. I implore you to take a class with Dr. J, especially if you're into EE."
13,4.0,3.0,0,0,"The most knowledgeable professors I've ever had. The class sometimes is a little dense but very informative. Grades are from participation, take home midterm, 5 quizzes and a group presentation that isn't too bad. The only thing I didn't like is he takes forever to grade midterms, we didn't get ours back until the day before the final."
14,5.0,4.0,0,0,Love Jenkins. Highly recommend his class.
15,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Solid lecturer, but very slow grader. Would take another of his classes."
16,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Jenkins's level of knowledge is crazy intimidating, but he manages to balance that out by being incredibly accessible and relatable to his students. More reading than I've ever had in my life and a couple of long papers, but he gives incredibly detailed feedback and is always available for help. You'll come out with super detailed knowledge"
17,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Very, very, knowledgeable about Eastern Europe (as expected). Definitely would not hurt to have some background knowledge as Prof. Jenkins can skip around and reference all kinds of events. Although the class is dense and requires a lot ( A LOT) of reading, Prof. Jenkins' knowledge will make sure you learn much about this area and its politics."
18,5.0,4.0,0,0,"This class was super lecture heavy but super interesting. Jenkins knows an incredible amount of information about Eastern Europe. There's lots of reading in the class, so be aware of that."
19,5.0,3.0,1,0,"I also had Professor Jenkins for POLI 260, and he's definitely one of the best teachers I've had so far at this school! He cares a lot about helping his students succeed and will give you lots of helpful feedback if you ask. Attendance does matter and there's usually a lot of reading every week, but if you show effort he'll grade you accordingly."
20,5.0,3.0,3,0,"He knows a ridiculous amount of information about transatlantic security, but he manages to make this information much easier to understand. There are probably seventy pages of reading per night, but it is mostly interesting stuff. Participation in class is a must; there are no exams, but there are a lot of writing assignments. "
1,3.0,2.0,0,0,Participation once a week. tough grader for a 100 lvl course. Exams are a mix of multiple choice and short response. Readings for class are sometimes long. This class will likely take more time out of your day than any 200 lvl course. 
2,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Jenkins made a T/Th class interesting! Class is very reading and participation heavy, but if you go to lecture and pay attention she makes it very easy to succeed. Did not like the class at first as I thought the workload may have been too heavy for a 100 level, but it really is all for your benefit. "
3,3.0,4.0,0,0,Professor Jenkins cares for her students but for a 100 level class grades to harshly. Attendance is not mandatory but you have to participate weekly. There is pop quizzes and the readings can be difficult. There is multi part definitions for simple words which make the class harder than it should. Must attend all classes to do well in the class. 
4,4.0,3.0,0,0,"This class isn't necessarily easy, but you should do fine if you put in effort and study before tests. 2midterms=30% , final=25%. participation/in-class assignments=10%, paper=25%. If you don't want to try that much for a 100 lvl course don't take this, but if you are okay studying a bit then do. it is manageable. Most honest answer on here so far."
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I took 2 courses with Dr. Jenkins, & she was honestly the professor who made the biggest difference in my life at UNC. If you are a first gen or at all interested in medical or sociology she's a must. Her grading is fair, and criteria is direct, she's personable in office hours. Essay based exams: give verbatim definitions and know CONTEXT!!! 10/10"
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,"This is a class that requires a lot of reading, class participation once a week, and class attendance (as she does not post the lecture slides). While the reading may make the class feel tough, the material and lectures are engaging and easily digestible. The tests are easy if you attend class because she reviews at the beginning of each lecture."
7,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Easy A if you read assignments and go to class. Have to participate once a week otherwise its in-class assignments, 2 midterms, 5 pg OP-Ed, and final. Very flexible and responsive to student questions. Highly recommend as she really makes subject matter interesting and understandable"
8,4.0,4.0,0,0,"At first, I wasnt a huge fan but shes definitely one of my favorite professors. She truly cares about her students! great in-depth lectures, she explains things very well. quite a few in class assignments. make sure to participate once a week because she is big on that. 2 midterms, 1 5 page paper and the final. The material was very interesting !"
9,3.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Jenkins is a nice person. Her class is extremely structured and she obviously cares about the material. Once a week participation is mandatory and in-class assignments occur on a weekly basis.
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Kalleberg is wonderful! The lectures are entertaining and are also engaging. No tests or quizzes, just short papers weekly/biweekly in which you must recall the required readings (which were short). No final exam. "
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Class was interesting and engaging, and super easy. If you're not doing well you're not trying. He mostly stands out for how he is as a person! He really cares about his students and makes an effort to know everyone. He's not the most tech savvy, so we spent a lot of classes with him on the phone with its, but we laughed it off! HIGHLY recommend"
3,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Kallegberg is the funniest professor on campus, and he makes class entertaining! As long as you do the work you will get an A!"
4,4.0,1.0,0,0,"I took Dr. Kalleberg's FYS about happiness, and it was a great experience! He's a funny guy and he cares about his students. Also, the class wasn't difficult - as long as you're a decent writer and you do all the assignments, his class will be fun and fairly easy!"
1,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Avoid at all costs. One 15 page paper determined much of grade, with very little feedback provided (no feedback provided on drafts, one class period to work on paper and professor wasn't present). Ended up with a B- on paper and never saw score for final exam. Cannot recommend strongly enough that you take any other class to satisfy 400+ POLI req."
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Mary was super sweet, caring, and understanding!  Her lectures can get a little plain at times, but overall great professor.  Willing to provide help outside of class.  Tests were open note just make sure to answer questions fully.  We had one 15 page research paper due at the end, but she makes sure we keep up by submitting topic and rough draft."
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"This class does have a lot of readings, but she makes it very easy to understand the readings by giving us questions we discuss in the class. She is probably the nicest professor I have had here, and I am a Junior. Nothing to pay for and not much work that is graded, but it is not hard to do well if you keep up with readings (I did not) :(."
4,4.0,2.0,0,0,"This class only had 2 papers and 2 exams, but none were hard at all and the papers were super interesting. Mary's lectures can be a little dense at times but she covers a really good amount of material. The readings are used in class but not on exams. Overall she's a good professor."
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Such a great professor!! Really passionate about her research and what she teaches, and she's such a kind and engaging professor."
6,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Prof. Kroeger is very energetic and invested in the content of the class, and is an overall delight of a teacher. Very understanding and would reach out to you personally to congratulate you on impressive papers. 3 papers worth 20% each plus a final exam make up the bulk of the grade, but the concepts were easy and she isn't a tough grader!"
1,3.0,4.0,0,0,Genuinely nice guy but class consist of just discussion by students. This works great for some but I struggle with theory and would have preferred for him to lecture and tell me the important things I need to know. Left the class often with more questions then when I first came and feeling like I had just wasted my time. 
2,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Kurzman is so kind and really cares about his students. 2 online exams which are open note, and 3 papers which are very difficult but doable. There are notes due on the readings every class, which take up quite a good amount of time but help you greatly with your understanding."
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Reading questions are helpful, but there is a good bit of reading. That & attendance will help your grade tremendously. Papers are not difficult and exams are open-note. As long as you read and take good reading notes, this class will be a breeze. "
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"This class is foundational and the content is very important. It can be rough at times because you have to turn in daily reading notes and read sometimes dense theory, but he makes it the best it can be by condensing readings and guiding learning. Dr. Kurzman is so kind, clearly loves the material, and updates the newer theories taught."
5,5.0,3.0,1,0,"Doing the reading is critical- it is a theory class. Class mainly comprises answering questions students have on the homework. the readings can be boring and hard but many are really interesting. He does a great job of trying to incorporate diversity within the required readings. 3 papers(30%),midterm(15%),final(15%), readings(20%), attendance(20%)"
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,Dr. Kurzman has been one of my favorite professors here at UNC. I have taken 2 classes with him. He is one of the most understanding and kind people you will meet. He is respectful towards everyone in the class and values all student's perspectives. I 10/10 recommend taking any class that he teaches!
7,5.0,2.0,0,0,Dr. Kurzman is a gem. I would not have wanted to take this class with any other professor. He is really knowledgeable and tries to incorporate some kind of activity in each lecture. I will note attendance is mandatory and there are reading notes due before each class. But I honestly felt like I learned so much in this class. 10/10
8,5.0,5.0,0,0,"For this class, readings were accessible and didn't require purchasing textbooks. He is knowledgeable, respectful, and flexible to meet during office hours. He is strict on exams and grading work. He gave great lectures and completed his goals for this class. Preparation and organization in this class are key to passing. Not an essay A."
9,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof Kurzman is very knowledgeable about everything we learned in class but is a very tough grader. The mandatory reading notes are easy and a great grade boost. On tests there is only one right answer, so if you don't answer it exactly how he would like you won't get the points. He is very helpful in office hours, especially regarding the 3 papers"
10,3.0,4.0,0,0,Professor Kurzman has very clear guidelines for assignments but is a harsh grader and counts off for the smallest things. Each point you miss off of an assignment is a point off of your final grade. Readings are time consuming and sometimes boring but he is very knowledgeable about the subject and he genuinely care if you learn the material
11,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Kurzman was a solid choice for SOCI250. The class itself is difficult but, he is really caring and is open to questions. There is a lot of work but, it is all purposeful and helps on midterm and final exam. I recommend if you don't mind mandatory class meetings and reading notes due every day (which are not as bad as they sound)!"
12,3.0,5.0,0,0,I think he makes social theory about as interesting as it could possibly be.  You can tell he is very knowledgeable about what he teaches.  He is a very tough grader.
13,4.0,4.0,0,0,He's a great teacher and really cares about whether you know the material or not. The papers and test are HARD but if you do the (mandatory) reading notes every day then it shouldn't be too bad.
14,2.0,4.0,0,0,Kurzman is a difficult lecturer and even more difficult grader. The paper assignments are ludicrous
15,4.5,3.0,0,0,"Kurzman is an AWESOME sociology professor. The course material doesn't exactly lend itself to fascination, but Kurzman is clear and explains exactly what you need to know. The exams aren't bad as long as you listen to his instructions and they are open book so be sure to take notes verbatim. He is great."
16,4.0,4.0,0,0,"I guess he hasn't taught this in a few years, but he must've gotten better because he is AMAZING. Generally this would be a super boring course, but Kurzman makes it simple, clear and to the point. He grades kind of hard, but it willing to work with you. Learned so much, which I needed as a soci major."
17,4.5,1.0,0,0,"I loved this class. The subject matter can seem obscure at times (Foucault, Haraway, etc) but Kurzman's lectures are engaging and clear. However, the TA's were painfully out of sync with the material. As long as you do all the work, an A is guaranteed. Definitely worth it."

1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Lindquist was a great choice for NSCI 395! This is mostly independent research in which she is not too involved, but she will give you guidance on the paper or any logistics if you ever need help. She is super easygoing, and if you do your work, it's hard not to get an A. "
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I had Dr. Lindquist for the class portion of the Senior Honors Thesis in Psychology this past semester. She was a great professor! She's a researcher too, so she's very knowledgable about thesis-related things."
3,5.0,1.0,0,0,Love Professor Lindquist! She's super knowledgeable and genuinely nice to people. You need to take this class if you are interested in this subject!!!
4,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Pretty solid first year seminar. Interesting studies, sometimes didnt feel like I learned much but Lindquist is very nice and knowledgeable."
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Easily my favorite class during my first year. Dr. Lindquist is incredibly knowledgeable and is a leader in the field. She's really down to earth and is pretty light on her grading. Interesting material, too. While the final project can be a lot of work, it's also pretty fun. A fantastic seminar!"
6,5.0,1.0,1,0,Lindquist gave a really inspirational first year seminar that incorporated a good balance of group discussion and lecture. She allowed us to think deeply about material without loading us with homework. Make sure you really participate and don't get lazy because participation matters. She's a brilliant person and a really caring professor.
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Lindquist made class very interesting and engaging. She clearly was very knowledgeable and wanted us to learn as much as we could. I would get excited to come to class even though it was a late class on Fridays. I would highly recommend taking any class she teaches!
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,Do anything you can to have her as a teacher.
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,"She knows her stuff.  She's intelligent and very well spoken but is never condescending.  You don't have to like psychology to enjoy the class. There was a lot of outside reading of scientific articles, but you can skip or skim one here and there, and you'll  be absoultely fine! She also provided study guides for exams. Very inspiring class!"
1,2.0,1.0,0,0,"She's nice but I didn't enjoy this class much. The content was disinteresting to me, she calls on people at random, and the excessive amount of GRQs was unnecessary. Grading was pretty fair and lots of extra credit. I've taken 8 PSYC classes, I think it may  be harder for people who haven't had psyc experience, especially for a 100-level course."
2,2.0,1.0,0,0,"The final project was graded horrendously, along with the other papers throughout the semester. Not really bad grades, but points taken off and no real explanation. She wants to randomly call on people in class too, so be prepared to have an anxiety attack!! "
3,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Li is very passionate and knowledgeable about child development psychology. Two lectures and one group activity each week. Her exams were tough, but she offers enough credit from papers and participation that it is still possible to get an A. She really cares about each of her students, so if you put in the work this is a great class!"
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Li is a really skilled lecturer, she is engaging and funny. She begins every class by playing music relevant to the topic of the lecture and often includes memes or other pop culture references in her slides. There are several readings, more so in the beginning but they are completely necessary. Big group project at the end. Dr. Li is great."
5,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Reading the textbook will get you a better score on the tests than going to every lecture. The lectures weren't the most engaging, but the content was interesting. There's lots of flexibility in the course (EC, dropping the lowest grade in every category other than test) so it's important to be strategic."
6,2.0,3.0,0,0,"This class is conceptually easy (mostly common sense). The TAs do all of the grading so if you get stuck with one that grades harshly you're out of luck. Dr. Li is not super approachable but she does try to implement feedback. Overall, I think the course content is interesting but don't go in expecting an easy A. "
7,4.0,3.0,0,0,"This was an interesting class, but wasn't an easy A for a gen-ed requirement. Several papers, a final group project, 3 exams, a final, and frequent check-up quizzes. There's some peer discussion in class, but it is mostly lecture-based. This topic is worth learning about, but it was definitely a more challenging course than I expected it to be. "
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,The class isn't hard and the content is interesting. There were three unit exams that were each worth 10%. There were four papers throughout the course and she dropped the lowest paper grade. She also offers a free one-week extension for any one of the papers. The final was an exam and a group project. I highly recommend taking this class. 
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Li is super accommodating and understanding. Almost every type of assignment has a ""drop lowest"" including participation and papers. She does a great job at making diversity a focus in the course which was refreshing. Lectures were always easy to understand. A lot of textbook readings but that's pretty expected from a psych class. "
10,4.0,3.0,0,0,She was a good professor and her lectures were pretty straightforward but her exams are set to like 20 questions so it was easy to miss one or two and make a B. Quiz every friday but you can take with a group the second try 
11,3.0,2.0,0,0,"Not many assignments. Pretty easy class, but she's oddly uptight about it. I also noticed she slipped up a few times content-wise, but never corrected herself. And the exams aren't difficult, but they're harder than you'd expect. That said, they're open book and open internet, so even if you don't know something, you can probably find it."
12,5.0,4.0,0,0,"She as an amazing teacher, unfortunately I didn't get the best grade because I was focused on other things, but she was amazing and would help you no matter what and would even reach out to you for help when she saw you were struggling. "
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I have to give her a 5/5 because of her character. The class was quite decent, and the lectures were solid, albeit sometimes a little boring. Rosa was awesome though, I liked it a lot when she made jokes, and she was always highly organized, prepared and understanding. She is an excellent professor and person. "
14,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Li is a pretty good professor. The layout of the course is really nice and organized. There's a lot of working in groups, so this would be a good class to take with your friends. The course content is generally very interesting and she explains things well. The work load is very doable. She makes it very easy for her students to succeed"
15,3.0,3.0,0,0,Dr. Li was understanding of pandemic stress; you can get an extension on anything. I found this class boring as I knew a lot from being a teen on social-still overcomplicated. Lectures go fast and can be confusing- if you have a q she'll often have you search through the hour long recordings or long readings. A nice person and not hard to get an A
16,2.0,4.0,0,0,"60% of your grade is determined by two exams in this class. I have gotten A's in participation, essays, and projects and then grinded for the exams and finished class with an 89.51. I assumed this would round up and I even emailed her but she wouldn't."
17,3.0,4.0,0,0,This course is pretty easy but it is impossible to do well in it if you do poorly on the midterm or final. They both make up 60% of your final grade!! Tests count for so much that the other minor assignments barley affect your grade.
18,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Li was extremely understanding of COVID and its effects on students and worked hard to overcover the barriers of hybrid learning. Her class is heavily weighted on two exams, but both are completely based on the lectures, and the criteria for assignments were always clearly established. One of my favorite professors in the psych department!"
19,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Overall a pretty good class. 60% of the grade comes from two exams so if you don't do well on one it's hard to do well in the class, but what will be on the exam is pretty clear. Several papers/projects, but those were fairly straightforward."
20,2.0,3.0,0,0,This course is pretty easy but it is impossible to do well in it if you do poorly on one of the exams. The tests count for so much that the other assignments barley affect your grade. The assignments are mostly group assignments with a group of 2-3 that she selects. This class may have been worth it if it counted as a general education requirement.
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,The amount of inappropriate jokes this woman makes is hilarious!
2,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Attending class is mandatory, as she says things during class that do not appear in the readings. I'm not a science person and thought this class was difficult because of the amount of science-based terminology in the first half of the class, but not impossible. Would highly encourage to read the lectures and start studying several days in advance."
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Loeb is an amazing professor. Her lectures are super engaging and fun; she explains concepts in a way that makes so much sense. Textbook readings can be a lot, make sure to start in advance. She clearly loves psychology and is so knowledgeable on the subject. I can not recommend her enough, if you are taking psyc 101 take it with Dr. Loeb!"
4,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Loeb is a great professor and obviously cares a lot about what she teaches. She does not post any slides to go back and look at outside of class, so make sure you go to class to get the information. Take good notes for the exams, they are tough, but manageable if you go to CLASS. Loeb was a great professor, but I am glad Psych 101 is done. "
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Loeb is awesome. She makes lectures engaging and interesting. With that said, to do well on exams attendance is mandatory and you MUST read the textbook. This class also had the most extra credit opportunities I have ever had in a college course."
6,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Loeb is very nice and generous with grades. Her funny anecdotes seem initially engaging, but eventually became corny and irrelevant. Exams weren't a great indicator of core content mastery, more regurgitation of niche class examples. Class is run by TAs, which can lead to confusion. Overall, a decent experience with a few hiccups along the way."
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Great professor, engaging lectures. Exams can be tricky, so be sure to read the textbook and attend lectures. 10/10. "
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Loeb is honestly so amazing. She's very passionate, her lectures are intriguing, she's witty, and she gives a lot of extra credit for the students to succeed. Although her exams can be tough, the class is not predominantly exam-grade-based. I love her and I would definitely take her again. "
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,I loved this professor. The tests were very easy and reflected the content. As long as you download her notes outlines and read it will be fairly easy. She also curves A LOT. The first test she curved 8.5 points. She is funny and her lectures are super engaging. The only slightly annoying thing is the heavily weighted attendance policy.
10,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof Loeb is amazing. Great lectures, very clear grading and class outline, and relates well to students. Class isn't hard if you do the readings and pay attention. Would absolutely take her class again. "
11,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Loeb has very engaging lectures and knows her stuff. However, your tests count for a lot of your grade, and they're definitely difficult. If you're not good at applying content/info, then be prepared b/c the tests are all application. Participation matters. I really enjoyed the class and her lectures, but I have found it difficult to keep an A. "
12,5.0,4.0,0,0,"LOVE Dr. Loeb. Tests are definitely hard and there is a lot of reading, but she is genuinely so caring. Lectures were always hilarious and she is so passionate about the subject. Definitely a good balance of difficulty, and I learned a lot. "
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Loeb is awesome!!!! Great lecturer, very engaging. Lots of opportunities for points/ to boost your grade. Heavy on reading but if you do it, exams are not difficult. Participation is a big part of your grade!"
14,5.0,4.0,0,0,She is very kind and understanding! There are many opportunities for extra credit but the exams can be pretty difficult. If you study and read the textbook this class should be pretty easy. 
15,5.0,3.0,1,0,"Prof. Loeb is genuinely one of the best teachers I've ever had. Even in a 200-300 person lecture hall it was so easy to learn from her. She makes content relatable and always cracks jokes. There is so many opportunities for EC and as long as you stay on pace with textbook readings and listen to lectures, it's a super easy course, def. recommend!"
16,5.0,2.0,0,0,"If you read the textbook, take good notes and pay a little bit of attention during class then it'll be easy, you just need to study a bit before each exam. she gives a lot of extra credit and bonus points on exams, so it boosts your grade by a lot"
17,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Loved Professor Loeb. Super interactive and does extra credit if you answer questions or participate. Her in-class assignment, which shows you are present in class, are not graded on accuracy, which is nice, but she usually tells the answer eventually. Great at making topics relatable to students."
18,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Lots of extra credit opportunities. Loeb is a great lecturer and the class is super interesting. We have quizzes which are easy, exams aren't difficult but do require a lot of studying/memorization. Reading the textbook is important. Attendance isn't technically mandatory but there are in class assignments you can only complete if you go. "
19,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Favorite professor so far at UNC. Lectures are witty, entertaining, and easy to follow. She is very well spoken and makes psychology fascinating. The workload consists of one-two textbook readings a week, which are 30 pages and come with an easy quiz. Exams are considered to be tough, but your reading notes help and she gives exam extra credit!"
20,5.0,3.0,0,0,"passionate prof. She changed tests to closed notes 3 weeks prior to the exam after the drop period; however, she gave a massive bonus credit. Lots of extra credit. I would recommend doing these things to get a good grade... read EVERYTHING, take notes, annotate note outlines she gives, find examples for concepts.
Great prof, I highly recommend!"
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,Dr. Maman is a great lecturer! She makes broad topics easier to understand and also provides lots of outside resources to help her students succeed in her classes. She is also kind and understanding when it comes to due dates. A great choice as a professor for any health behavior/public health class!
1,3.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Marks was a pretty solid teacher. He was really passionate about the material and was willing to talk outside of class. The class itself wasn't very hard. Your grade comes from attendance/participation, a presentation or a debate (your choice), a final paper, and a midterm and final there were both take home. Attendance is mandatory."
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,Professor Marks is a fantastic lecturer and cares very much for his students. While the class was writing/essay heavy he gives students all the necessary resources to succeed in the class. And his worldly perspective and experiences makes learning from him even more enjoyable.
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Marks is incredible - he is obviously very knowledgeable on the subject (he's legitimately famous in the worldwide POLI community) and incredibly easy going. He has pretty clear cut grading criteria, and I feel like he takes into consideration the effort you put into the work when grading. Overall, he's an amazing professor - take him."
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"He is the best professor I have ever had at UNC. He lectures a lot, but they're actually really interesting. He is incredibly nice, will get back to you ASAP, always willing to meet with you, and is very positive. He harshly critiques writing, but doesn't necessarily take points off because of it - he just wants you to be a better writer. Love him."
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Great Poli lecturer. He's an expert in European politics, and is very well-connected with post-grad and international opportunities. I've taken two of his classes! Fairly easy A if you do your work, and Prof. Marks genuinely cares about your success and you as a person. He was very understanding about COVID circumstances. Class is lecture heavy."
6,5.0,4.0,0,0,Prof Marks is seriously like the smartest professor I have ever had. He's a legitimately famous political scientist & it's a privilege to take a class w him. Weekly debates were interesting. He tends to monologue during discussion but honestly I loved hearing what he had to say so no complaints from me. Plz take a class w him if you can!!
7,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Marks is a credit to his profession. Passionate and knowledgeable lectures combined with personal anecdotes allowed for an excellent classroom experience. Marks was a reasonable grader and understanding teacher, and I greatly enjoyed my time spent in his classroom"
8,5.0,2.0,1,0,A brilliant political scientist. His class is a real treat for those who have a particular interest in European politics. Lectures are woven with British wit and very informative experiences from Dr. Marks -- his stories of doing research during the Cold War are particularly intriguing. He had a clear system of grading with feedback.
9,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Fairly easy A. He's British & his stories were awesome. (Ask him about his time in East Berlin!) His wife is also an awesome Poli professor, and we interacted with her too. Doesn't allow electronics, and lectures sometimes got a little long, but overall I would definitely take a class with him again."
10,4.0,4.0,0,0,"I loved Marks and his lectures. His insight to all things European was very helpful as well. However, his TA did all the grading (Dave Attewell), and he graded very harshly."
11,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Marks is a good prof. He engages with the class and works hard to explain materials. he cancelled class frequently due to travel, which was nice. However, there are only 3 grades, and they are all graded by the TA. Dave Attewell was our TA and he graded very difficult. Take a class with Marks if there is no TA, and Avoid Dave Attewell!"
12,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Marks is incredibly smart and well known.  His class is lecture based and there are only 3 grades - midterm, paper, and final.  Depends on the TA as far as the grading, but Professor Marks does a good job of explaining and promoting discussion"
1,3.0,1.0,0,0,Poli 434 was a very easy class. 55% of the grade came from either attendance or assignments that were graded on completion. She takes attendance but does so randomly. As long as you show up to class and turn things in you will get an A or an A-.
2,3.0,3.0,0,0,"She lectured a lot and would go off on tangents that meant we didn't cover all the material in class. Her lectures were also a little hard to follow at times. Overall tho, I learned a lot abt Mexican politics and feel informed enough to speak on current events. She gives lots of little low-stakes assignments. Its a lot of work but not too hard."
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I absolutely loved profesora Martinez-Gallardo. She is so passionate about Latin American politics, and was so so kind. I'm taking her POLI-434 course this Spring, and I'm super excited! "
4,1.0,3.0,0,0,"Tedious lectures. Irresponsive professor. We didn't know any of our grades until right after the final. Pretty disorganized as well. Easy material, but the grading style was a little odd. "
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"The absolute cutest. I love this woman. She's so caring, kind, and involved. Really stresses mental health and learning to learn, very flexible. Totally recommend her Poli 238 (latin america) or Poli 434 (mexico)!"
6,4.0,2.0,0,0,"She is clearly passionate and knowledgeable about Latin American politics, and that can come through by means of information overload - she sometimes gets lost in all the things she wants to say. However, she is very sweet, clearly cares about her students, and will give you plenty of opportunities to bring your grade up. Easy grader!"
7,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Gallardo-Martinez is super sweet, caring, and understanding. Lots of extra credit. Pretty easy course. Lecture heavy. Overall, pretty ok course, which I enjoyed it more."
8,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor was respectful, knowledgeable, and understanding. This class is a good foundation for contemporary Latin American politics. Readings for this class were accessible, and the due dates were clear as well. I would suggest paying attention to the readings and studying reading questions will prepare you other topics and exams."
9,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Super sweet, caring, and loves the topic. I recommend taking this class especially if you're a Poli Sci major! Cons: readings can be long, exams have few questions (but are fairly easy), she's a little disorganized and can get off topic Overall I def liked it, lots of EC, interesting topics, sweet woman!!!"
10,5.0,3.0,0,0,Great professor. CMG was always willing to help and her class was very engaging.
11,2.0,1.0,0,0,"CMG shifted the class so that 35% of course grade comes from participation--which I think was supposed to make it easier (given COVID), but actually just culminated in the expectation that you do like 100 forum posts over the course of the semester. The whole class is tedious busy work and is not very interesting. Take HIST 242 with M. La Serna."
12,5.0,2.0,0,0,"CMG is great! very kind and caring during COVID times. Lectures can drag if you're not interested in the material, but the content is very interesting! Midterm and Short paper and Final not too difficult. Discussion posts before every class."
13,5.0,4.0,0,0,"She's truly amazing! In COVID times, she really understood that her class couldn't always be a mental priority for us. The class is very much based on paying attention to the notes so you get out of the class what you put in. The exams are very straightforward if you pay attention. I adore Prof. Martínez Gallardo as an instructor and as a person."
14,4.0,2.0,0,0,She really cares about her students' mental health and is not a harsh grader. I managed an A in both the midterm & final and studied 1hr for each. So long as you keep up w the little assignments it's not a difficult class! She's a great person in general & very knowledgeable about the content
15,5.0,2.0,0,0,A gem. She is very understanding of Covid plus gave us days where we chose to make class optional because of outside factors. Knows sooo much about Latin America. Participate and do the discussion questions and you should be good. Her paper is easy and midterm was quite simple. Overall a great professor.
16,4.0,2.0,0,0,"great professor, sometimes a bit unclear but was always willing to answer questions. willing to stay after class. a bit hard to reach at times. PARTICIPATE in class discussions, she really cares about that. nice person who was willing to work with you if you had issues. if you do the readings, and the assignments (not many) you should be fine"
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,"CMG is a real gem! Although this semester was hectic with things moving online due to COVID-19, she always made sure to let students know that she was available. Her lectures are engaging and even though the reading can be extensive at times, it is interesting if you enjoy Latin American politics. One paper, participation, a midterm, and a final."
18,4.0,3.0,0,0,"She is a nice teacher, and is very passionate about the material. Her grading rubric is clear, 25% participation, 25% midterm, 25% paper, and 25% final. If you skim the readings and take notes in class, you'll do fine."
19,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof. Gallardo's class was impactful and engaging. She isn't always clear about what readings you need to be doing, but you definitely don't need to do all of them, just pay attention to her lectures. Her exams were difficult but the subject matter was fascinating and she really knows her stuff. All in all a very nice woman and cool professor."
20,3.0,3.0,0,0,I cannot stress how there are only four grades in the entire class. You cannot do bad on one assignment if you want to do well in the class. The subject matter is very interesting but CMG seems very out-of-it in class. She gets off topic quickly and very often. Lectures were long and often boring. Don't take unless needed for your major.
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"This class was challenging, but Professor Martin always did her best to help students grasp difficult concepts. I came into this class with no coding experience, but I learned so much by the end of the semester. I would highly recommend taking her class. She is also very lenient with grading and she is always available to help students. "
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Martin made coding so much less scary than I thought it would be. I knew nothing coming in, and was able to complete a large scale project by the end of the semester. She is so patient and will always give help when you look for it. I cannot recommend her enough. "
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"POLI281 is pretty difficult subject material, but Dr. Martin's lectures made it really easy to understand. You have a long time to work on the homework assignments and collaboration with other students is encouraged. As a major who wants to follow this career path, this was exactly what I was looking for from this class."
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Martin is one of the best UNC professors if you have the chance to take her class do it!  The content was a bit difficult, but she gives students opportunities to ask for help when needed.  She is very caring and was willing to push several due dates back when needed.  I thought I'd hate the class bc it is coding but she made it really easy."
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Martin is super competent and makes learning coding easier than it should be. She is also super accessible outside of class if you are struggling along with the ULAs.
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,Lucy is a goat and any political science student at Carolina should be ashamed if they don't take a class with her. 
7,5.0,4.0,0,0,"I have loved Prof Martin! She is really funny and generally pretty kind. She seems to have really high expectations, but I'm not sure how much of that is just the expectation for a 400-level class. Lectures are very fast-paced, tough to take written notes. Grade is mostly papers and exams, but decently fair grader!"
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,Prof Martin is one of the best professors I had at UNC. She is extremely caring and understanding while still challenging students to learn and expand their skills. I came in with very little knowledge of the material and ended the class thoroughly enjoying it. She was always willing to meet to discuss the material and assignments. 10/10 professor!
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Martin is one of my favorite professors i've had while at UNC. She teaches 281 very well and will ALWAYS answer any questions that people have. The ULAs are also very helpful on assignments and group work is fun if your group is engaged. Would definitely recommend this class with Prof. Martin!
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Martin taught this class very well. Generally, each class consisted of half lecture time and half hands-on practice time. Prof Martin and the LAs were always available for the practice time, so it was very easy to get help if you didn't fully understand the lecture. Not hard to get an A if you go to lectures and do the practices."
11,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Very difficult class, but Martin is extremely caring and aware of the difficulties this class possesses. She is flexible with deadlines and is always willing to help. Genuinely cares about students learning and overall well-being."
12,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Martin is by far the greatest professor I have ever had. She is kind, understanding, and resourceful. The material is difficult especially if you are not much of a tech person, however, Professor Martin and the ULAs will help you on every assignment. As long as you put in the work and ask for help, you will succeed in this course."
13,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Martin was great! The class isn't easy, but it's also not prohibitively difficult. I came in with no knowledge of coding and left feeling like I can actually use this software in my day-to-day life. She was incredibly flexible and understanding both pre and post-coronavirus, and was very mindful to look out for her students. I recommend."
1,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Prof McGuire is a great professor. He is witty so lectures are usually fun. He does rely heavily on test grades for the final grade, which is difficult if you have test anxiety. He is easy to reach and willing to accommodate. Great professor and I will be taking a class with him again."
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Amazing professor!!!! The material is quite interesting, he made it easy to actively participate and made students question their own judgement (in a good way). The exam questions are written answer and very straight forward but he's quite picky about your wording and specificity (beware!). PUT IN THE TIME TO STUDY
"
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof. McGuire's class is unlike anything I've ever taken. At its root, you learn and understand court precedent through exploring and debating in class an issues history. About 80% of every class was devoted to discussion, which he drove with an energic albeit unhinged style. The class is based on tests which aren't hard if you know your stuff."
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,Professor McGuire is amazing. He makes material that would be dry to many very interesting and fun to learn due to his charismatic lecture style and wide breadth of knowledge. Anyone who has an interest in American Law should seriously considering taking this class or any others taught by Professor McGuire. 
5,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Great professor, really engaging, and pushes you to think critically about the positions you hold relative to the cases discussed. 3 exams and forum posts are all the grades in the class. Like has been stated before, no surprises and pretty straight forward. "
6,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor McGuire is a really nice guy and definitely wants to help, but I have never taken a more boring class at UNC - especially in the Poli department. Every class is just him lecturing about Supreme Court cases, and although that's the content of the class, he could have done so much more to make it engaging. A warning might have been nice."
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Awesome lecturer and very knowledgeable about the stuff he talks about. He normally gives the facts of the case and has the class discuss what we think about it. He's also really good at expressing the arguments for both sides of the case, which makes the class a lot more interesting. Test are straightforward and don't have any surprises"
8,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Confusing. Last minute assignment changes, poor feedback, lack of clarity in class, assignment,mark and comments. RUDE."
9,5.0,4.0,0,0,Professor McGuire is by far the best professor Ive had at UNC and this is one of the most interesting classes I have taken as well. His lectures are very interesting and riddled with dad jokes. He goes over most cases in class and the rest come from the book. Graded on 3 tests and discussion posts on piazza.
10,4.0,2.0,0,0,His lectures are very interesting but he does not go over all the cases you will be tested on so prepare to read the textbook for certain cases. Pretty cool guy until you get to controversial cases where he has to play devil's advocate to make students participate in the discussion.
11,5.0,4.0,0,0,"McGuire is dedicated to making you understand why court cases were decided the way they were and on what basis. He is fascinating, knowledgeable, and tells great dad-jokes. He is a must for any POLI student focusing on US constitutional politics. He expects precise answers but exams are based in the lectures - no surprise questions."
12,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof McGuire is a nice guy and his lectures are interesting enough. Your grade for the class is almost entirely based on three case-analysis exams (28% each) and there is no extra credit. He's quite a rigorous grader, wanting your answers to be exact and not really entertaining much creative interpretation. But an overall cool guy and solid prof!"
13,4.0,3.0,0,0,"This is the 3rd class I've taken with McGuire & he's a great professor. (FYI they're all the same in terms of format). During Zoom Uni he's recorded & posted all his lectures online. I also recommend utilizing Oyez for his classes, it helps a lot! There aren't a lot of grades but if you pay attention & take notes it's fine! Dry but great humor"
14,5.0,3.0,0,0,"McGuire is easily one of the best professors in the poli sci department. If you have any interest in the Supreme Court or are considering law school, definitely take this class! McGuire's lectures are fun and engaging, but it is worth noting that attending class is essential to doing well in the class."
15,5.0,2.0,0,0,"All assignments and exams were super clear and easy to understand. The textbook readings were short and clear as well. His exams are only hard if you don't attend class or are not able to independently understand the readings, as we never go over them in class. McGuire as a person is hilarious and very understanding. Would take any class with him!"
16,5.0,3.0,3,0,"If you're a political science major or interested in the Supreme Court, take this class. Professor McGuire is easily one of the best teachers I have had here at UNC, no cap. The grading and assignments are clear and McGuire makes the class enjoyable. Also, McGuire is definitely the funniest teacher at UNC."
17,5.0,3.0,1,0,"McGuire is hilarious and super knowledgeable about his subject. He is very caring, but also is not afraid to call you out- in a funny way. The class is based off 3 in-class essays which total to 10% of your grade and then 3 exams that are 30% each of your grade. The final is essentially a 3rd exam and only based on material after the 2nd exam."
18,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor McGuire is my favorite Poli professor because of the clear and interesting way he teaches.  Though test prep may take some time, there are no curve balls on his tests.  Attendance and participation aren't required, but by going and paying attention you'll have all that you need for the lecture part of the tests.  Very nice and funny guy!"
19,4.5,3.0,0,0,"Professor McGuire has become one of my favorite professors at UNC. If you're interested in anything related to the Supreme Court or the Constitution, he's the best pick. I've also taken his Supreme Court class and it was excellent! Professor McGuire is a fantastic lecturer and always encourages student dialogue. "
20,4.5,2.0,1,0,Professor McGuire has been one of my favorite professors at UNC. The course was 4 non cumulative tests and a 10 page paper. He is clear about expectations and he is an engaging lecturer. If you are pre-law I would highly suggest taking him as this class is mostly constitutional case study.
1,2.0,4.0,1,0,"I wanted to love this class. Unreasonable readings. PPTs (not posted) have more flair than substance. The random musical outbursts were endearing until they quickly weren't. He lectures in this dramatic, rehearsed voice and at times it seems like he's more interested in putting on a performance than making sure students understand the content. "
2,5.0,2.0,0,3,"Everyone should take a class with Meier. He's passionate about the subject, and does a good job of explaining what the real world implications of ethical frameworks are. This class is great for anyone who wants to engage with public policy. For the people complaining about the difficulty or readings, maybe the honors section wasn't the best choice."
3,5.0,4.0,0,1,"Professor Meier is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. I couldn't recommend him more. His teaching style is a bit unconventional (frequently sings during class), but it makes the class memorable. He does assign a ton of reading, but it is almost always interesting and topical. He is by far the most passionate teacher I have ever had at UNC."
4,2.0,3.0,3,0,"I was excited to take the honors section of this course as I was told it would be a seminar style, debate-heavy class. Meier teaches 340 as if its a performance with a script and complex slides for each class that focus more on aesthetics than content. We rarely engage in extended full class discussions which he subjugates to the forum. "
5,2.0,4.0,2,1,I took this class to fulfill a gen ed and to get an honors credit. This ended up being the hardest class I took (I think I'll finish with a B or B+) and the class I spent the most time on. There is a crazy amount of reading and the grading criteria for essays and writing assignments is extremely vague. Would not recommend (unless ur a plcy major)
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"TAKE A CLASS WITH MEIER!!! He does assign a lot of reading, but quizzes are short and readings can be skimmed for main points. His lectures are so entertaining and he really cares about his students. "
7,5.0,4.0,0,0,"While he does make you work for it, Professor Meier is an incredibly passionate lecturer who does his best to make sure his students know he cares. There is a lot of reading to be done, and he expects active discussion, but the class is a lot of fun, and you really feel like you get a lot out of it."
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Really enjoyed this class- you definitely get back what you put into it. Prof Meier cares so much and is truly passionate about his subject (literally was Zooming in from Geneva if needed). Definitely some reading, nothing unmanageable, but don't expect to do no homework just because it's a fys. Would recommend!"
9,4.0,4.0,0,0,This class will be difficult and you may struggle but not without wonderful themes and a caring professor. My knowledge on global health policy is limited but you do have a few takeaways from the class. Less guided thinking and more on your own. Overall I liked the time I spent and it was worth it and I might just know how to save the world.
10,3.0,4.0,0,0,"The problem is how vague it is. Although he is fun will dance in the class, talks in different voices, themes, and plays music. No grading criteria and no specificity when it comes to expectations. In some cases, he does expect you to know more about Public Policy than what we do know especially since this is an FYS. Just be prepared. Okay class."
11,3.0,4.0,0,0,"He cares about the material & helping students, but class was stressful, participation is absolutely mandatory (and he'll make you feel bad if you don't), the participation ?s sometimes don't relate to the day's readings, there are 4-5 long readings per class with daily quizzes, & no grading criteria for the papers worth 15-30% of your grade."
12,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Amazing class with an amazing professor. In light of the class being held online, Professor Meier was accommodating and provided very engaging lectures and assignments. While the readings were a bit dense, Meier provided a lot of opportunities during office hours or other times to discuss the class topics in greater detail. Would highly recommend!"
13,3.0,5.0,1,1,"Hardest class I've ever taken. Meier is an amazing human who cares about his students, but his exams are unnecessarily hard and assigns hours upon hours of dense philosophy readings every day. Could never work on any of my other classes it was so much. Tough grader, expect to work your butt off with little reward. Screwed my mental health."
14,5.0,4.0,0,0,"I looked forward to attending this class each day. I was new to global health and found the textbook to be comprehensive, insightful and thought-provoking. The lectures then enriched lessons from the text through class discussions, case studies, and informative PPTs. Make it a priority to take a class with Professor Meier!! He's truly inspiring."
15,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I went into this FYS without much knowledge about public health and absolutely loved it! Professor Meier does a great job of making it enjoyable and memorable. There is quite a bit of reading (3 readings assigned per class), but overall very manageable workload. To anyone considering him and/or PLCY76H, 10/10 would recommend!!"
16,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Meier is definitely an expert & super passionate about global health. Every class has a theme (Hamilton, Star Wars, etc) which makes it more fun. We had readings & a (pretty easy) reading quiz before each class, & 2 papers + a final paper. Participation is key (20% of grade). I did learn a lot & people interested in health should take this class!"
17,5.0,4.0,1,0,"Dr. Meier is an amazing professor. He is the only prof I am looking forward to taking another class with. Professors can have their own political opinion, this is not high school--life is political, people need to face that reality. He is always open for conversation & if you have differing opinions, voice them instead of writing online."
18,1.0,3.0,1,1,"Meier might not directly lecture opinion but he makes it very clear which side he thinks is right and chooses to only present certain information on a topic. Theres nothing wrong with professors being liberal, but there is something wrong with being unable to disagree with them"
19,5.0,3.0,1,0,"One of my favorite professors I've had at UNC, Meier truly cares about his students and it's very clear that he is teaching in order to help create a better future. He is inspiring and has incredible experience and wisdom in human rights. Lectures are o entertaining and musical. While you can tell he is left leaning, he doesn't lecture opinion"
20,5.0,4.0,1,0,"Dr. Meier is the most inspirational professor I have ever had. I left his class inspired to work and change the world. This class is very difficult and has a lot of readings, but all of the work felt worthwhile and necessary. His jokes and Hamilton references are hilarious and he is always kind and caring in office hours."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"This is my third class with Ted, so you can guess that I'd take more if I weren't graduating! The work load is above average, but the readings are typically interesting which helps a lot. You get to explore some unique topics as well. Class is discussion-based, so if you don't prefer this format, it's not the class for you."
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,Ted is one of the kindest professors that I have had in my career. The man makes an extremely difficult subject like statistics accessible and comprehensible to most people including 'non-statisticians' such as me. He genuinely cares for his students and will do his utmost to help them succeed in the class. A gem of a man!!
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,Awesome professor! My favorite class I've taken at UNC. You learn a lot by just interacting and discussing with your classmates and Ted. Not a lot of work and 4 essays including the final. Easy class and worthwhile. Thanks Ted!
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Ted is hands down the BEST professor at UNC. He is so understanding and honestly just a great professor. no tests, just 4 reading questions and 3 SHORT essays (3 pages max) and one final 5-page paper. take him at any chance you can, you seriously wont regret it. i wish i took him for all my mngt classes!! class is all discussion based as well!!!!!"
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Can not recommend enough. The class is mainly discussion on the readings (which there are a decent amount). He does a really good job trying to include everyone in the conversation. There are small assignments before every class on the readings. A few essays throughout the semester, but not too bad and he is understanding about circumstances."
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,"SOCI58 is a class entirely based around discussion, and professor Mouw facilitates very interesting discussions on a variety of world topics. He is extremely kind, and was very flexible over the course of the semester. A great first year seminar and Professor Mouw is the perfect person to lead it. Only 3 papers on topics discussed in class"
7,5.0,2.0,0,0,There's around 40-50 pages of reading with 4 questions due before every class and 3 papers (3 pages double spaced) along with a final paper (min 6 pages) that is based on any topic from class. Participation is extremely important. He's super accommodating and the discussions are really interesting! I highly recommend this class!
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I can't recommend Ted enough! He's kind and will work with you on deadlines if needed. There's a fair amount of reading and you must turn in reading notes every class, but they're very easy. The class was entirely discussion-based, so you need to participate! He's been accommodating with COVID, too. Take a class with him if you get the chance!!"
9,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Ted is a super caring prof, and I've taken multiple classes with him and will continue to take more if I can. If you have difficulties making a deadline, he will work with you and is very accomodating. There is a fair amount of reading, and he will make you work to achieve the A, but it shouldn't deter you from taking his classes!"
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,So understanding and kind. Loves facilitating discussion. Assigns papers and daily reading notes but they're ezpz. Pulled thru for pandemic and made the final 10 T/F questions that we went over in class.
11,5.0,2.0,0,0,Ted is my favorite professor that I've had this semester. He cares so deeply about his students and is so understanding as he would rather see us get a good night's sleep than stay up to write an essay even if it means turning it in the next morning. He is so knowledgeable and provides incredibly insightful commentary. Cannot recommend him enough!!
12,5.0,2.0,0,0,Fantastic professor. Very enthusiastic about the material.
13,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Ted is LITERALLY AMAZING!!! so caring and understanding. super sweet and you get positive vibes. 3 SHORT essays (3 pages at max) and 1 5-page essay due at the end of the semester. Reading notes due before every class, but VERY easy (3-4 questions). If you have the opportunity to take him, do it!! you will NOT regret it!"
14,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor was incredibly helpful, accomodating, and nice. Participation matters but he makes it easy for you to participate and encourages you to speak. Will call on you if you look like you're spacing out but he's only trying to help you. Readings are interesting; he isn't harsh with grading and the assignments are easy."
15,5.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Mouw really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He is very accessible outside of class and accommodating for the final paper. Readings and class discussions are interesting. He's very funny and shares hilarious stories about his life. Even if you do the readings and come to class it's hard to get an A
16,5.0,2.0,0,0,He is definitely one of the best professors I have ever had. He is a really funny and super caring professor while also making the lecture fun. He assigns a reading guide every class that has four questions which will take 30 min max. The in-class essays are super easy as long as you pay some attention in class.
17,5.0,2.0,0,0,Dr Mouw is one of the nicest profs that i have come across. Although he deals with a difficult subject he deeply cares for his students and genuinely wants them to succeed. he isnt in the business of looking good. rather he wants to the best he can to help the students. no one fails in his class. that is his biggest success. i love him
18,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Ted is really funny, caring, and kind. He seems genuinely passionate about the subject. Participation is a HUGE part of this class. You need to come in ready to speak because he will call on you if it looks like you aren't paying attention. There's assignments of around 60 pages of reading and writing 4 short paragraphs due for each class."
19,5.0,2.0,0,0,"He's a great teacher. LOVES extended discussions so be ready to talk if you want to do well! There are reading notes (not too long) for every class so that's a bit tedious. Also, there's a 6 page paper and a final. Overall pretty easy but you got some work to do!"
20,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Ted cares about you as a student, and is flexible with work if you email him ahead of time. There are reading notes due every time the class meets and are based on 30-50 pages, which can be overwhelming but he puts the page number where you can find the questions information and that helps a lot. He's really passionate about the subjects."
1,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Prof Mulligan's PSYC601 course was very lecture and reading heavy. You are graded on very few things- 3 exams, a couple of discussion forums, and a couple research article question assignments. "
2,4.0,3.0,0,0,"I took PSYC430 as an async remote class and thought it was great. Even though Prof. Mulligan can be a dry and slow lecturer, lectures are prerecorded and can be sped up. I barely read the textbook, but did have to read journal articles to complete homework assignments. Graded by few things, but he's straightforward about exam structure."
3,4.0,3.0,0,0,"I took PSYC 430! Nice guy, but dry lectures. Don't take if you aren't into classes where you have to take notes the whole time. The material we learned was interesting, so it wasn't that awful! I never opened my text book once, but did have to read articles in order to answer HW. Everything on exam was covered in class! Easy grader if you tried."
4,2.0,4.0,1,0,"Dr. Mulligan is such a great person and very helpful when you reach out to him, but this class was HORRIBLE. The material was dry, the lectures were almost unbearable, the tests were ridiculously specific and hard (a, b, c, a and b, b and c,all of the above :/), and the grading criteria was so subjective with zero feedback. If you can avoid, pls do"
5,1.0,4.0,3,0,Extremely boring lectures in which he manages 75 minutes so poorly that half the material on our tests was never discussed in class. Tests are poorly made with extremely difficult answer choices. The paper assignment is graded very harshly with absolutely no feedback. The only truly bad psych prof I've had at UNC.
6,1.0,4.0,3,0,Literally worst class I have ever taken here at UNC. The lectures are ridiculously boring and he talks about smaller aspects of the course material for way too long. He's not engaging and talks for the entire 75 mins of class without asking any questions or allowing us to discuss. The tests ask questions that are so specific and not important.
7,1.0,4.0,3,0,"There were 3 tests and one of them was scheduled right after a spring break!!!!???!??!??! The final is cumulative and all tests together are worth 80% of your overall grade so there is absolutely NO ROOM for error. Very boring lectures, so sitting for 75 minutes without getting distracted was sometimes impossible. Avoid Dr Mulligan at all costs!!!"
8,3.0,4.0,2,0,"If you don't attend the lectures, you won't pass. The majority of the tests are made up of what was discussed in class (80% lecture based, 20% textbook based). Lectures are extremely boring but you need to listen and take good notes. Grades for this class include in-class quizzes, in-class writing assignments, one paper, three midterms, and a final"
9,5.0,3.0,1,2,"I had Dr. Mulligan for PSYC 210, which is basically statistics. He's a really great lecturer; he repeats himself and does a bunch of examples on the board to make sure the material is clear. The textbook is essential, since you have homework out of it often. Overall, I thought the class was reasonable and I would recommend it to others."
10,5.0,3.0,0,3,"Professor Mulligan is an amazing professor. I had him for PSYC 210 and 230, and I am planning on taking 430 with him. He provides many examples during his lectures to help students grasp concepts, and he also adds some humor. Most of the material on the exams come from his lectures; however, a few questions are pulled from the assigned readings."
11,5.0,3.0,0,2,"Dr. Mulligan makes the material much more interesting by giving us experiments corresponding to the cogntive concepts discussed in the textbook. The tests focus A LOT more on what we covered in class and knowing textbook concepts is definitely secondary. Overall he's a very nice, clear, and helpful prof but at 8am the lectures can get boring."
12,4.0,3.0,0,2,Definitely knowledgeable and willing to help. Lectures can be boring (especially at 8 am) but he can be humorous.
13,4.0,3.0,0,2,"Pretty knowledgeable professor and generally a nice guy. I suggest taking notes on your computer because he can talk pretty fast. Also, avoid this class if it's after lunch, because it's easy to fall asleep and get bored. Study hard for the tests, they can be a bit challenging. Overall, an okay professor."
14,5.0,2.0,1,2,"He really knows what he is talking about, and is really helpful in answering questions. The class is very interesting - *IF* you're into psychology and models of cognition/memory, and he can be hilariously witty at the most random times. Tests are multiple choice/essay, and not too difficult, but you've got to go to class."
15,4.0,4.0,0,2,Great teacher but lectures were really boring.
16,5.0,3.0,1,2,I had Prof. Mulligan for Cognative Psyc. and Human memory.  I thoroughly enjoyed both classes.  He explains the material extremely well and he is very willing to help his students.  You can tell he is interested in the material he teaches.  It is important to attend all his lectures.  I would recomend his classes to anyone interested in psychology.
17,3.0,3.0,0,2,"Unless i just dont like the material this class was pretty dull, but he seemed nice"
18,4.0,4.0,2,4,He's a nice guy but exam & paper grading is far too arbitrary. Depended exclusively on essay questions and was incredibly subjective in grading.
19,4.5,3.0,3,0,Really nice guy. Explains things thouroughly.
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Words can't describe my love for Keely. She is so sweet and really cares about her students. She wants you to learn and class is not about the grades. She takes a more unorthodox approach to class, there's no textbook and class is all discussion based."
2,5.0,3.0,1,0,"keely is such a sweet person, and she is a great professor to teach classes on social neuro. she loves the material and answers questions fully. the class is heavily graded on just a few things - a paper, participation, and a quiz. the final was only worth 10%. class discussions are interesting and engaging! lots of reading, journal articles mostly"
3,5.0,3.0,1,0,Dr. Muscatell is super smart and respected by students. Really enjoyed her lectures and was glad to be exposed to social neuroscience (a new and exciting field). Readings are usually long but most are interesting. Would have liked to read things other than journal articles all semester though (which I think she's changing). Highly recommend!
1,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Dr. North is the best!  I hope to one day eat blunch (mid-day breakfast) with her and talk about the human genome.  Keep on rocking, Dr. North!"
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,I love Dr. North's enthusiasm in her teaching and in her research in the field of her class. She is amazing and passionate!
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,she rocks
1,5.0,4.0,0,0,Prof. Oprea is the real deal. Highly recommend.
2,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Oprea is an excellent and clear presenenter! She gives great feedback and is happy to discuss concepts outside of lecture. There's a significant amount of reading that is necessary if you want to do well, as she has high expectations for essays. However, if you do the readings and participate in class, you will be prepared."
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Oprea is a great professor. For this class there was a lot of reading at at times it was really heavy. Everyday she put us into discussion groups, where we talked and then presented our ideas, which she counted as participation. She was incredibly helpful in office hours and honestly just great to chat with. Highly recommend her!"
4,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Definitely a respected professor and she really is passionate about it, which helps. She knows the material really well. However, the lectures are often pretty mundane and sometimes she runs the risk of over complicating things. Not a hard class, do the readings and youll be fine. Youll like this class if youre really into PPE."
5,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Oprea is an amazing teacher that delivers well worded and organized lectures. Yes, some of the material may be a bit dry but she presents the information in a concise and understandable manner. Class attendance is paramount to getting a good grade on the take home exams and for understanding the material."
6,2.0,3.0,0,3,"Boring and unhelpful lectures, but pretty easy class. When she explains things, she tries to use as unnecessary and complicated a vernacular as possible. The readings are actually easier to comprehend without her explaining them, and I just kept my AirPods in every class and managed to get an A by doing all the learning myself. Shes nice tho!"
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Oprea's class required a lot of reading but all of them were interesting and relevant. The class had some lecture but mostly centered around debate which made the 3 hour long class bearable. Professor Oprea is very helpful and clearly very passionate about PPE.
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Oprea is extremely knowledgeable about all of the topics we discussed in class. She makes you think and argue for philosophies or theories you don't necessarily agree on, but I find that valuable. I think that she also is a fair grader."
9,5.0,3.0,1,0,"Alexa is a very effective lecturer, and was always careful to explore philosophical, political, and economic implications during lectures. Course consisted of a game theory quiz and three take-home essay exams. My only gripe would be a relative lack of feedback, but she is accessible outside of class. Look forward to taking the capstone with her!"
10,5.0,3.0,1,0,"This course solidified my intent to pursue PPE. Despite being new, Prof Oprea is by far the most eloquent and effective lecturer I've ever had. She is fully deserving of a teaching award, and I will definitely take her again."
11,5.0,3.0,1,0,Very good professor. Cares about students and is very helpful outside of class.
1,4.5,3.0,0,0,"Dr. P is great. She is completely bonkers, but so kind and sweet. She really cares about her students and makes you want to do your best. The class itself was very interesting and didn't have too much work associated with it. I would highly recommend her!"
2,4.0,4.0,0,0,Dr. Panter is awesome!  She really cares about her students and is really easy to talk to.  She super enthusiastic about stats.  I would definitely recommende her :)
3,4.5,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Panter is the most caring professor I've ever had. She really cares about each individual student and always takes the time to ask you how you're doing. She is SUPER enthusiastic about statistics. She's kind of a perfectionist, but always has a positive attitude. I'm definitely going to keep in touch with her after this class!"
4,3.5,5.0,0,0,"Dr. Panter is a wonderful woman and professor. She is so sweet and is always concerned with how people are doing as individuals, not just their performance as students. She is not always clear and doesn't always answer e-mails but she is brilliant and more than willing to help you with anything you could ask for."
5,4.5,4.0,0,0,Amazing!!! She is THE Prof. to take. Any class that she is teaching....TAKE IT! You will not be disappointed.
6,4.5,2.0,0,0,Dr. Panter is absolutely wonderful. She's brilliant and cares so much about her students that it's insane. Every once in awhile you come across a professor that truly makes you WANT to learn and master the material and come to class! She is one of them and I adore her.
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,She is a very fun teacher who loves working with research and numbers.
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Parekh is genuinely one of the best professors I've had. I took this class online, and it was HARD, especially with 60+ pages of notes crammed into a summer session. But her lectures are so clear to listen to and interesting, and her assignments are easy if you put in a bit of effort. I highly recommend taking her (and go to office hours!) :)"
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,"NSCI 279 was such a doable lab, unlike any of the chem labs taught at UNC. 10/10 recommend taking with Dr. Parekh"
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Parekh is the best professor ever, she totally understands tough circumstances and even though her tests are a bit difficult, they are fair and you can totally get through them!"
4,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Parekh is incredibly thoughtful and kind. She genuinely cares about her students' well-beings and adjusts deadlines to accommodate. Although the material is dense and the exams can be tricky, there are many opportunities to boost your grade. The tests are also online and take-home."
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Loved this class, she is so sweet and really loves her students, she offers a ton of help outside of class and is very understanding when it comes to outside situations, Exams were a bit hard but If you study in advance it is manageable "
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"THE SWEETEST PROFESSOR ON UNC'S CAMPUS!!!  Dr. Parekh loves what she does, and you can tell!  She is very patient and will go out of her way to make sure you understand a concept.  Don't get me wrong, this class is tough and there is a lot of material, but the way she teaches makes you feel very prepared for exams!"
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,Dr. Parekh is a professor who cares about her students. This class is not an easy class since there is a lot to learn and memorize but she tries her best to help her students. She is accessible outside of class for any questions or just chatting. Don't buy the textbook it is available online! She gives optional guided readings which are nice.
8,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Amazing teacher Who truly cares about her students, I think she was one of the best professors I have ever had and truly inspired me to pursue the field of neuroscience. I think that she is a wonderful person and teaches very well and is always very very willing to help."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Parikh is great. She teaches about the things that matter. It wasn't that hard of a class considering it was a stat class. I wouldn't say it should really be a psychology class, though. Either a stats or maybe ethics class, but it wasn't psych heavy at all. The software was super easy to use. "
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I loved having Professor Parikh for this course!  She is super understanding and gives the perfect amount of work that isn't too overwhelming.  Attendance isn't mandatory and is done on PollEv, and there is a midterm and a final that are both open-note and moderate.  Overall, I really enjoyed this class and loved having Parikh as my professor!!"
3,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Dr. Parikh is a great professor, and she really wants her students to do well. This is not a difficult class as long as you attend class and watch the video lectures she posts online. She gives you time to work on the assignments in class and ask questions if you have any. Great class, but beware the final was extremely difficult for no reason. "
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Really easy class if you are decently ok at stats. The assignments are written out step by step. She is extremely flexible and caring! The two lowest grades of everything were dropped (minus the exams), but we only had a midterm and final so it was worth it for sure. Recommend! "
5,5.0,3.0,2,0,"Assignments in this class are kinda hard and the TA's grade very harshly depending on which one grades yours.  Final exam was nearly impossible and brought a lot of people's grades down, did not match the energy of other quizzes or midterms in the class, the final was just unnecessarily hard"
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Parikh is an amazing professor. She cares about her students and allows them to work on extra credit. In my opinion, the hardest item in her class is the final. Attendance is not mandatory, but if you do not go you might miss something very important. She also has review sessions that are very helpful. I would definitely take her class again."
7,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Loved this class, she is very kind and truly cares about her students. She is always offering help and making sure you are graded fairly. You get to select your group for the final paper and although it is really long it is split up throughout the semester so it doesn't feel too bad at the end. "
8,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Does PollEV for attendance. Quizzes and Midterm are super easy, everything is online. Makes sure you never fail and can never get lower than 75 on the comprehension Q's. Some of the assignments can be hard but you are allowed to work in groups. Great professor and wants you to pass with an A and you will understand the material, if not you'll be ok"
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Take this class with Prof P! There are online video lectures before each class so you learn at your own pace. She ended class early on Thursdays to give us time to work on the assignments. There are weekly assignments, a few quizzes, and a take-home midterm and final. All quizzes and exams are open-note and online. Super easy and not a lot of work!"
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,"There is a reason Professor Parikh has 5/5. She is awesome! There is one semester-long GROUP paper that you submit parts of along the way, so submitting at the end isn't too difficult or overwhelming, and you get feedback. All of her classes were zoomed and did poll ev, and every Friday the whole class was given to work with your group."
11,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof P is a gem at UNC. Her classes are insanely easy and I didn't go to class except for FDOC. She zooms her classes and does poll ev, so I just did them from home. Fridays also don't have poll ev's. 1 weekly assignment that took about 1 hour and with the slides were easy. Exams are also take home. If you need a PSYC class, take Prof P!!!!!"
12,5.0,3.0,0,0,"parikh is very caring and easily accessible! she really just wants everyone to understand the material and succeed. she gives notice of upcoming assignments, quizzes, etc. way ahead of time and it is easy to fit the amount of work she gives into a weekly schedule. it is not exhaustive and adds to your understanding. also extra credit things too!"
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Parikh is amazing. I recommend taking any of her classes. There are 10 assignments and 5 quizzes, I  believe, which are easy. The midterm was tough, and the Final was harder, but not impossible. She also allows for extra credit and she is always there in class or in office hours to be able to help if you are confused. Use your resources. "
14,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I can't say enough good things about Dr. Parikh, she is such a great professor and person! Her lectures are very engaging and she is very kind about deadlines. Her class was also super accessible, as she had a Zoom link up for every class in case anyone had to miss it in person. If you have the chance to take any psyc. class with Dr. Parikh, DO IT!"
15,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I loved Prof Parikh! Her class was very accessible (offered zoom) and she was such an amazing person overall. Very understanding of personal situations, passionate about the work, caring towards her students. Definitely recommend taking a class with her.
One assignment due a week, very manageable."
16,5.0,2.0,0,0,Love Prof Parikh!! She really cares about her students learning the material and actually getting something from the class. Just do poll ev's and she has zoom options. Pick a good group and you'll be set. Lots of good feedback and easy to get help. Take classes with Prof Parikh. (Also had her for 220 and she was equally amazing) 
17,5.0,2.0,0,0,"This class was fairly easy, and prof P's very kind and cool!  Make sure to keep up with assignments and poll ev participation!  Grading may seem a bit rough at fist, but just incorporate feedback into the final project! Provided example assignments help too! Learning checks were not bad as long as you study the notes! Extra credit was given at end!"
18,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Her lectures are can be boring/redundant but she is always there if you need extra help on the material/research paper. Class is easy as most of your grade is a semester-long project divided into small due dates throughout the semester, the learning checks/final exams are open-note, and 1/3 class are project workdays. Highly recommend taking her! "
19,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Certainly not one of the most interesting courses at UNC, but Dr. Parikh made it great. This class focused on a semester-long group project with 2 quizzes throughout. Extremely manageable. This was my second class with her and she was still an amazing professor. I recommend her courses to anyone. "
20,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Parikh is an amazing professor! If you have the opportunity to take her class, do it! Our class consisted of either an assignment each week or a quiz (although there were only 5 quizzes throughout the semester). The midterm was fairly simple, but the final was a bit more challenging than anything we did in the class."
1,5.0,1.0,0,0,"This class was super easy, definitely would recommend. The material wasn't hard and he explains it very well. There are discussion questions due every week, but they are easy. There are 3 exams and a final, and they were all easy as long as you paid attention in class. Plus you get to use notecards on the exams."
2,1.0,2.0,0,2,"Dr. P is another hypocritical hater of white Americans.  He believes white Americans are too blame for all the misfortunes of minorities.  Dr. Payne, if really believe this, you need to give up your position as professor for a minority who did not have the same opportunities as you.  If you want to be propagandized  by a Communist take this class. "
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Awesome teacher. The material is super interesting and he uses a lot of examples that are relevant and interesting. Tests are pretty easy, and papers are on interesting topics."
4,3.5,2.0,0,0,"stereotyping. tests are fairly easy, can drop the lowest one. short paper, everyone got an A who did it. lectures are sort of boring, but the material can be interesting. better one-on-one"
1,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Pearce was very kind and understanding! The class was easy - lectures were pretty stale and often avoidable if you took notes from the textbook readings, midterms were online, and assignments could be low-effort. Hardest part was the final research report, but Dr. Pearce sets up assignments to make it easier!"
2,3.0,3.0,0,0,"This class had relatively interesting material, but the class was beyond boring. There were 6 units and for each unit, you took the quizzes, did assignments, and watched lectures alone and then met as a class to review. Im the end we only had class 6 times. Quizzes are the hardest part of the class."
3,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Pearce is super nice and helpful! I had issues with a group project and she made sure the project was graded on individual work by sending out group evaluation forms! There are quizzes for every chapter, 2 exams, a couple assignments and a final group research poster! The lectures are pretty boring because the content isnt that exciting"
4,4.0,2.0,0,0,"If you know the main concepts for the different topics, you should be okay on the exams. They are straight forward. There's a group project that happens throughout the semester but it isn't that bad."
5,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Pearce is very passionate about what she teaches. She is also very accommodating to her students. Her class is very easy. Attendance is not mandatory as I never came to class and also, never studied for a single exam yet still got an A-. Definitely recommend taking courses with her."
6,4.0,2.0,0,0,"A great class if you love reading sociology books and then discussing them in class. Lots of reading but I thought it was doable for meeting twice a week. The research project we did involved going to churches in the area and taking fieldnotes about what happened, we then wrote a group paper about our research."
7,1.0,2.0,0,0,The course material is very interesting but the most boring professor I've ever had. She usually doesn't talk about anything of relevance to the course but uses confusing graphs the entire lecture. I learned more from reading the book and teaching myself the content.
8,3.0,3.0,0,0,"The lectures are unnecessarily slow and boring. The material is pretty easy to follow as long as you do the readings and listen in class but the tests are a little difficult. The assignments are easy. Overall, the material is interesting and the class is low maintenance."
9,3.0,2.0,0,0,"Interesting content, but she gives VERY dry lectures. Should be an easy A if you keep up with the reading and take notes. Some test questions and short writing assignment prompts are unclear or confusing which can be frustrating. Despite this, she is very nice and cares a lot about her research which she ties into course content."
10,1.0,4.0,1,0,"She was unprepared, failed to tie material together, makes students work harder than we learn or get back from the class, arbitrary and unnecessarily tough grader. Worst class I have taken. Frustrating and felt like a waste of time"
11,4.0,2.0,0,1,"She is very dry.  Her lectures go so slowly, but her class is easy.  She is passionate about research and very nice."
12,5.0,3.0,0,1,"Class is heavy on lectures and a bit dry at times but not too hard. Easy to succeed if you do the reading and ask questions in class. Lots of opportunities to get help if you need it, she is very accommodating."
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Penn was great. Tried to make it the best he could as an 8am. Exams worth 80% of grade and you get to drop 1 (not the final).  5 papers (20% of grade)- 1 gets dropped. If you do the study guide for the exams and know it you will do good on the tests. Papers had clear criteria and were only 2 pages long, I did them the day b4 it was due and got 100s"
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I loved being Taught by Professor/Dr. Penn! I had him at 8:00 AM and his class always woke me up in the mornings. He would play videos before class to help wake us up. Also, he would mention sometimes which things would and wouldn't be included in an exam. He had 4 exams, including a final, and 5 papers which made up our whole class grade. "
3,2.0,4.0,0,0,"He's a great guy and he definitely has the intelligence and oratory prowess to impress. That said, I do agree that this 101 class is far too focused on deeper neuroscience/biological psych. That's what makes the class harder than appears. The lecture-heaviness isn't that bad; the slides are always uploaded online for study or if you miss class."
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Penn is an all around great professor, his tests are primarily composed of content he covers in his lectures so it's very important to attend the actual classes. This never really feels like a chore though because his lectures are always very engaging and he provides practical real-world situations in which the topics discussed are relevant."
5,1.0,4.0,0,0,"Penn is a kind and understanding man but not the best professor for PSYC101. The material barely focused on actual psychology but was about topics that didn't seem relevant. The exams HEAVILY rewarded attendance, be sure to take notes about every aspect of what is mentioned during the lectures. Only 3 essays and 4 exams were graded."
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Penn lectures heavy but the content is interesting and he uses lots of videos and tells stories for examples. The essays he gives are short and simple. The hardest part are the tests, but if you study you should pass them. Attendance is via Polleverywhere but if you miss class you miss important material that's missing from ppt."
7,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Penn is a great guy. If you want to make an A in this class, write down literally everything he says in lecture and then study your notes. You do not need the textbook at all. He also gave 2 extra credit opportunities and that helped me get an A. The only work you do outside of class is an occasional 2 page essay and studying before a test!"
8,3.0,4.0,0,0,"David Penn is a great guy, but for psych 101 you're probably better off taking another prof for psych 101. I even feel bad saying that because he's genuinely DT earth and cares about his students, but the tests are very lecture based and there were writing assignments that are graded pretty harshly. If you do take this class, write down EVERYTHING."
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I LOVE DR. PENN. Went into this class not knowing what to expect, & now I'm ending the class as a Psychology major. His class is lecture heavy, but he makes them interesting. He genuinely cares about his students and wants to see them succeed. He is one of the kindest professors I have had! Lecture mandatory depending on when he takes attendance."
10,1.0,3.0,0,0,Horrible communication and does not know how to use email or in-class technology
11,3.0,2.0,0,0,"I think Dr. Penn is a very nice and kind man. However, I find his lectures fairly boring which sucks, because his exams are solely based on lecture and very miniscule details. I didn't find the class necessarily hard, but I didn't enjoy it and had very low motivation to study the material."
12,5.0,2.0,0,0,"David is literally amazing. He is so nice and everything that he talks about in lecture, is exactly how it will be on the exam. The videos that he shows in class are humorous, and the real life scenarios that he provides are helpful. As long as you study, the exams will go well. I definitely recommend taking a class with him."
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,Best professor I've had. This man's lecture gets straight to the point and he clarifies a lot of the material. He is very funny and enthusiastic about psychology. Exams are challenging so I suggest recording lectures and going through his slides. There are few papers and participation is important. Textbook is NEVER used. Put in the work for an A
14,2.0,3.0,0,0,"Lectures were so boring, it was hard to stay awake through them. Didn't seem into the 101 class and was only really enthusiastic when we covered schizophrenia (which is his field of expertise). Participation is from PollEverywheres each day and he drops 10% of the lowest grades so you can still get a good attendance grade if you skip sometimes."
15,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Penn is good professor for teaching a 400 person lecture class. He tries to be funny and most times hes successful. Genuine, great guy who loves psych and makes the class enjoyable."
16,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I love D. Penn! He is very caring of all the students in the class; he tries to remember all the names and associate them with faces. His teaching style also allows people to understand information better. He uses a lot of examples, videos, and class experiments to demonstrate concepts, and it really helps with actually understanding concepts."
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,"D. Penn is such a kind guy. He is super understanding and does everything in his power to make the class easy to understand. If you dedicate the time to the material, you will get a high grade. He drops the lowest test, paper, and 10% of attendance. Super caring and likable. Would highly recommend."
18,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Not a hard class and not hard to get a good grade (A/A-/B+), especially if you go to the class. The tests are EXACTLY from the class, and not at all from the textbook. He tries to learn everyone's name even in a large lecture hall. Really nice guy, and cool prof. 5 writing assign which were tougher reading material than expected, not too hard tho."
19,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Love my man DP. best part about this class is that he refers to students as ""gang."" tests are harder than expected but take good notes and you should get an A."
20,4.5,1.0,0,0,"Loved this class! It is definitely an easy A. There are 5 short papers, 3 exams, and 1 final. You can drop the lowest grade for the papers and exams. Lectures are long but interesting. He likes to test people on the videos/examples/demonstrations, so take notes during those. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK. It is a huge waste of your money."
1,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Lots of busy work but very doable. Daily quizzes, polls, group project, and 3 write ups. 3 midterms were 10% each and final was 20%. If you get 100s in all the non-test categories and do all the extra credit, you only need to average an 85 on the exams to end with an A. Also Dr. Penton really grew on me throughout the semester. Overall, good intro!"
2,4.0,1.0,0,0,Dr. Penton is a passionate professor. Her class was interesting and has extremely similar/converging course content to BIOL 455 & Biopsyc. Tests are online and low-stress because of this. There are easy reading quizzes and group projects as well with opportunities for extra credit. 
3,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Penton is a good professor who works to make engaging lectures, but I found the overall course structure to be a bit disorganized. It was difficult to determine what you actually needed to know for tests. The class is not a traditional 'top down' approach- rather we often covered more specific information before knowing the high-level info."
4,4.0,3.0,0,0,"She's pretty funny. I didn't like her TAs all that much but that's not really her fault. Overall a pretty average professor, but that's good because there wasn't really much to complain about. The textbook is awful because there's not a lot of useful information in like 2 long pages of reading, it's like trying to find needles in a hay stack."
5,1.0,3.0,0,0,"Even if the class was hard, I've had pretty good experiences with other STEM professors at UNC. But with Dr. Penton, she is extremely disorganized and has a ""my way or the highway"" mindset when working in groups. I feel like I have not learned anything in the class and she is not very considerate toward her students."
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"The material is not easy, but if you are passionate about molecular neuroscience then you will love this course. Dr. Penton is a wonderful professor who cares about the well-being of her students. While the tests are hard, there are a lot of other assignments that act as a grade buffer. Expect weekly group work + daily hw quizzes"
7,2.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Penton is a nice woman but she is extremely disorganized and that is reflected in the course content and lectures. She puts a huge emphasis on group projects that are a huge waste of time and do not help you learn. You will need to teach yourself outside of class to pass the exams. Would not recommend. 
8,2.0,4.0,0,0,"NSCI 221 is unique. Heavy emphasis on group work, including weekend assignments in groups. Dr. Penton would often not finish the slides for the day, and I found the slides didn't prepare me well for tests and quizzes. Dr. Penton does clearly care about the material, but I found the course design did not help me learn well. "
9,2.0,4.0,0,0,I was very disappointed with this class. Dr. Penton would never finish any of her slides in class even though they were extremely rushed through. She also wasn't the nicest to her students. I thought the CREATE Method was a huge waste of time because of how much of the material we didn't get to learn in class. Overall just would not recommend her!
10,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Rachel is pretty nice, her tests are pretty hard but they are super buffered by other grades so it is not the end of your grade if you don't do well on them. There are a TON of assignments which blows, but it is groupwork so get a good group and you will be fine. "
11,4.0,3.0,0,0,LOTS of busy work but entirely online/asynch. A lot of the busy/group work is really pointless to the learning process but good in terms of grades because the exams were pretty hard and application based (covered a lot of material too). There's a lot of extra credit too. I think you can get at least 10 pts EC throughout the semester.
12,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Penton was super understanding the entire semester. She had a 24 hour grace period for every assignment, even quizzes so we could take them late. She also dropped the lowest 6 quizzes. This class was entirely online but you could complete the lessons asynchronously if you wanted. Lots of extra credit opportunities which boosted my grade."
13,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Penton is a great lecturer for this class, even if it was all online. She'll give you video lectures and in-person ones so that you can afford to miss a lecture or two. You have to read a fair amount and the exam questions are rather difficult, but if you study and put the time into it, you'll be fine. Focus on learning targets."
14,3.0,3.0,0,0,"This class is a lot of work, which is comprised of quizzes, writing assignments, class engagement, concept maps, dense readings, group projects, and exams. The grade was 45% on graded components throughout the semester and 55% were exams. This class was not enjoyable online as it was not engaging in this setting, but she is nice and tries her best."
15,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Our class was held over zoom, but the Sakai page was made for a fully virtual class so attendance was not mandatory. I will say, you will have no idea what's going on. She is very clearly a researcher at heart and overcomplicated most of the simple topics. To make up for this though, there is lots of extra credit and slack built in if you try. "
16,1.0,5.0,0,0,"She played her video lectures in class, paused to expand on a part a bit, and then continued to play it. Then, her lectures would expand into homework with readings and quizzes due before every class. She also has multiple group assignments which people tend to not shows up. Teach yourself type class. Exams are difficult for no reason (2nd)."
17,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Penton is a nice professor, but she is not my favorite. The class is lecture-heavy, but her explanations are confusing. She also loves group work, which nobody really participates in. Her tests can be difficult, especially since you will probably have to teach yourself most of the content. "
18,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Penton is my favorite professor at UNC and is super caring. Specifically, this class is insanely group project-oriented, so if that's not your thing skip this. Break out rooms for at least half the class and we all know nobody learns anything from that. But if this was in person maybe it would be better."
19,3.0,5.0,0,0,"Dr. Penton seems like a very nice person, and she's built in a lot of flexibility to the course. That being said, the workload is absoultely crushing. You basically have to teach yourself, and every 'lesson' is approximately 5 hours of work, all turned in for a grade. I understand that it's an online course, but theres essentially no interaction."
20,2.0,4.0,0,0,Every class was group work so there's not a lot of learning from her. Rely on learning the material from the textbook and 2 minute Neuroscience. Projects are back to back and heavy in material. She's a nice professor but the class could be set up better.
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I would recommend taking psyc 180 with him! The class was super insightful and interesting. He understands the stress of school and tries to be as accommodating as possible. He also allows you to talk about life if you need to. He's a good lecturer and explained material very well. 4 papers total but they were simple, easy, and interesting."
2,5.0,1.0,1,0,Dr. Prinstein is hands down the most caring prof I've ever had. I would take any class I can with him. He was gracious and really listened to his students and this class was genuinely so interesting. It was the most enjoyable class I have taken and was more about learning/discussing than handing out grades/work.
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"My favorite professor so far! Mitch is so nice, and he really cares about his students. The class was easy, as long as you go to class and watch the videos on knowmia. Relatively easy A especially if youre interested in psych. There were 3-4 papers that were actually interesting to write. 10/10 would recommend!"
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Mitch always made a point to accommodate to his students and the crazy semester we had. We had 4 papers, a midterm, and final. If you watch the lectures, participate in class, and do some readings ur good. The best part is everything we learn relates so much to our lives that you cant help but be interested."
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"By far the best professor I've ever had. Class was interesting and it revolved around the students and our personal experiences. He understood the difficulties we were all facing amidst covid and online learning, and was extremely accommodating to every circumstance. It was a large lecture but he was always accessible. great class and prof"
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,"How interesting the class is depends on how much you care about the subject, but Mitch is great no matter what he's teaching. He's very engaging and enthusiastic; he's been very understanding and flexible with the pandemic too. PSYC 180 is a newer class, so be patient while they work out the bugs. If you grasp the general concepts then you're fine."
7,5.0,2.0,0,0,Mitch is passionate about his work and wants to help all students succeed.  Midterm and final is graded fairly as long as you can demonstrate that you understand the material taught.  Always willing to meet and talk about the class/paper/etc.  Would recommend his classes!
8,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Amazing. Mitch is fun, friendly, and brilliant. This class is pretty easy. Try to get into his lab if you want research experience. He's an incredible mentor."
9,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Easy class. Got boring sometimes, but he kept it pretty interesting. Very engaging lecturer. I would recommend him for this class"
10,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Prinstein was great. I think stat is really, really boring, but he actually made it interesting. The tests and assignments were not hard at all, and he's a funny guy who really cares about his students. Fantastic professor, fantastic class."
11,3.5,2.0,0,0,"Funny guy who keeps a potentially boring class interesting. The class is pretty easy if you've had any stats before. Lab is useless, but tolerable. He is really interested in teaching and knows a lot about the subject, seems very willing to help out students; he's on your side (if that makes any sense)."
12,2.5,2.0,0,0,"Having only had him for independent study work, I must say that he is a nice professor, but is quite disorganized.  Make sure you spell out exactly what your questions are, and be certain that there is a clear agreement in what is expected."
13,5.0,2.0,0,0,Has a real interest in the subject.  Very engaging teacher which could make any class fun to be in.
14,5.0,3.0,0,0,Funniest teacher ever! Made a really crappy class fun (or at least not torture... I hate math)
1,4.0,3.0,0,0,"She tries really hard to be engaging & is funny most of the time (some jokes just don't land). The group project is annoying, but if your group is on top of it a good grade is doable. The TA grades just about everything so as long as you have a good TA it's fine. There are small responses due at the beginning of each class based on the reading."
2,3.0,1.0,0,0,She's really passionate about sociology and tries to make lectures fun. Bottom line: the material is not hard and you don't need to attend class at all. Grades are based on weekly quizzes and a few tests and papers; easy to get an A. 
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Honestly yes sometimes the lectures are a bit dry, but if you have a solid TA, the class will be a breeze. If you do the readings and take notes you'll get extra credit at the end of the semester just for doing them. I recommend her if you can get her, attendance is mandatory but also not at the same time. Midterms and final were pretty easy too. "
4,1.0,1.0,0,0," In one lecture she had twenty students come to the front of the lecture hall and line up by skin color in some backwards way of trying to make a point. She is well-intentioned but tone deaf and just misses the mark. Required attendance (even though lecture is large), made us read her own book even though it wasn't relevant to the course content."
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Ravenelle is really funny and her lectures are enjoyable. Although I agree with some of the comments saying that the group project was frustrating, I wouldn't let it stop you from taking the class as you can learn a lot from it! The grading was very fair and the readings were also really interesting."
6,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Ravenelle's class was not too bad. Readings were not dense but you need to do the daily participation assignments. Both the midterm and final were online, essay-based. About a month and a half is centered around a group project that was a frustrating experience. We were trained to use a coding platform that was not very helpful. TA was great!"
7,2.0,2.0,0,0,"She was ok.  Her lectures could be hard to sit through.  She tries to be funny/snarky, and it often doesn't really work out.  Pretty easy class, though.  I wouldn't say I recommend her, but I also didn't absolutely hate her."
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,She had really entertaing lectures and all of the homework/ tests were very easy. 
9,1.0,5.0,0,0,"On top of her unbearable lectures, Ravenelle had a terrible attitude towards her students and gave poor instructions for assignments. Grades were seemingly determined by her TA flipping a coin and were inconsistent across students and assignments. Rubrics were poor, and she had a group project as the final and the highest grade was an 80 lol. "
10,1.0,3.0,0,0,"Tries very hard to be funny but isn't. A lot of the lessons I learned from this class (which mainly came from the readings and videos she made us watch, not necessarily her lectures) I also learned in MNGT 131. What I couldn't stand is she would read emails but not reply. She would condescendingly tell u she read ur email. Very wishy washy."
11,1.0,3.0,0,0,"She's a smart lady, but very condescending and not considerate towards students. She gives no rubric or clear instructions on anything and grades very hard. I would avoid this class unless you need it for your major. Super lecture heavy as well, and very boring."
12,2.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Ravenelle's class was not extremely difficult (attendance assignments with readings, essays, essay-based midterm/final, and a big group project). There is not a rubric or grading criteria provided for any of the assignments, and she is a tough-grader. Not too hard of a class, but extremely boring lectures, and not very accommodating."
13,1.0,3.0,0,0,"The class overall was fine. Our TA was amazing and she did 90% of the grading. However, none of the professors assignments had guidelines and the one thing she did grade she was super harsh for no good reason. Lectures were extremely boring too. Overall the professor was not great but the class was fine."
14,1.0,3.0,0,0,"Would not recommend this class AT ALL unless you have to have it. I did not enjoy it and honestly, the material is all pretty much common knowledge if you've watched the news once since 2010. It's not hard but extremely boring and rather irrelevant. I also did not like the way I felt the professor had extremely vague instructions. Don't take :)"
15,1.0,3.0,0,0,"Do not take the class unless it's for a major. Professor Ravenelle is a nice lady, but not a considerate professor. There was many changes throughout the class which were not updated in the syllabus, like attendance! Lectures are very boring and a waste of time. No lectures are posted online for reference, so good luck on midterms/finals!"
16,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Ravenelle is a great choice for SOCI427. There is a lot of work including a group project but, it helps your grade in the long run. Midterm and final not super hard, just essays. She is pretty funny and keeps lecture entertaining. Definitely feel like I learned a lot too!"
17,5.0,2.0,0,0,Professor Ravenelle made a class about labor force fun and enjoyable. She also loves to play John Oliver clips once in awhile and she always assigns interesting articles related to class content. Highly recommend taking this course with her and also I love her humor!
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"She really enjoys what she's teaching! Very approachable. 
She was quite accommodating and seemed like she cared about how we were doing. 
However, she takes forever to give back grades. 
Tests were not bad. Doesn't give a rubric for papers, kinda vague. "
2,5.0,4.0,1,0,"Dr. Reissner was one of my favorite professors at UNC. You could tell how passionate she was about the content of the class and it made lectures so exciting. NSCI320 in general was such an interesting class, and she made accomodations for every student and truly cared about our well-being throughout the semester. She wants everyone to succeed!"
3,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Reissner is one of the kindest professors I've ever had at UNC, esp. with COVID. Willing to extend guidelines and work with the class if everyone agrees that something doesn't feel fair. She does grade pretty strictly for the tests, and they're really difficult if you don't take good notes. Two small papers, one longer research paper."
4,5.0,2.0,0,0,Dr. Reissner cares so much about the topic and that everyone is stress-free while learning it. A super interesting first-year seminar that everyone can relate to while Dr. Reissner being super nice about grading. She cares a ton and is always available. 3 papers graded nicely and a few fairly easy quizzes made this class super enjoyable
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Reissner is wonderful!! She cares deeply about her students success both in and outside of the classroom. Her lectures were very interesting. I would be excited going to her class. The quizzes and papers are not hard because she outlines the necessary information clearly. This is such an eye-opening first year seminar. I loved it!
6,5.0,1.0,0,0,Dr. Reissner was the best professor I ever had at UNC. Her lectures are extremely straightforward and in-depth. She's extremely efficient at preparing you for the four quizzes and four papers. She genuinely cares about her students and always puts their interests first.
7,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Reissner is absolutely amazing! Her depth of knowledge in the subject makes her lectures very dense and informative. She is very good at explaining the material and always answers questions! Although the material is difficult, she really wants her students to do well! My favorite class ever at UNC- it inspired me to be pre-pharm! Amazing class!"
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,Dr. Reissner's FYS was awesome. You could tell she really cared about the material and tried to get the class interested in it as well. Class was a super easy A- only homework is 3 short papers throughout semester graded basically for completion. Course material was engaging and relevant. Highly recommend taking this course.
1,5.0,1.0,0,0,"This review is for a 400-level politics class... Dr. Robertson prepares you for a political career in the world beyond the university, and that gift is priceless. Many classes you take in college will be of no use to you in the future, but Graeme is fantastic and brilliant. One of my favorite professors of all time. "
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,He is a very nice teacher and is always willing to help students understand their work.
3,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Interesting class but gets harder and more theoretical after the midterm. Lots of reading, but I managed an A without ever once doing any of the reading.A is set at 94; he will not round up anything. This was the Fall 2020 COVID semester, and it seems he gave everyone a perfect participation grade this semester. May be different in the future."
4,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Contrary to some of the previous reviews, I found him to be reliable and clear in his explanations and expectations. He is a knowledgeable and objective figure for anyone interested in Russia and the post-Soviet sphere, and can provide good insights. He is enthusiastic, and I think appreciates a genuine effort from anyone who applies themselves."
5,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Robertson is awesome in that he is very passionate about the material, and extremely knowledgeable. However, he's seldom available during office hours and doesn't seem to care much about how well students do. I loved his class and I think he's an awesome person, but I struggled a lot with his confusing instructions and disorganization."
6,2.5,3.0,0,1,"Professor Robertson is a nice man who, like most other UNC professors, knows his topic, Russian and post-Soviet politics, like the back of his hand. His lectures were simple and easy to follow. He does not believe in overcomplicating something that does not have to be and he has a gift for explaining things in a clear and comprehensible way."
7,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Great class, but lots of readings and workload. Exams are based on the quality of the argument, that means a lot of memorization and arguing your point."
8,5.0,4.0,1,0,Great teacher. Makes subjects interesting and has a lot of fun.
9,4.5,3.0,0,0,"Class is moderately difficult, but he helps fudge your grades for the better.  He's new and that shows with the occassional mistake in assinging work.  However, he is EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL,EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE about soviet politics.  If you're interested in world politics I recomend him."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Robertson is amazing- the class structure was sometimes a lot to keep up with because of how dense the material is, but she really cares and knows what she is talking about. Her exams were very fair and had no tricks, which was super comforting. She also emphasized daily how if we were struggling in any way she was available for help. "
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"LOVE this woman. NSCI 175 is an incredibly hard class, but she did her best to make it easier for students, including lots of extra credit. She is super sweet and exams aren't too bad, there is just a lot of information to cover. I definitely recommend taking her for 175!"
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Robertson is the best professor I've had at UNC! She cares a lot about her students and is very passionate about her classes. This specific course was super helpful as it is focused around networking, building your resume, etc. It was a great way to ""force"" yourself to network. I would recommend this course and this professor to anyone at UNC! "
4,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Robertson is one of the sweetest professors you will ever have. This class is hard but honestly, she is so accommodating and understanding that you are genuinely excited to go every time. She loves what she does and it comes through. I would opt into this hard class, as it was incredibly interesting and so applicable to the world."
5,5.0,4.0,0,0,"This class was one of my favorites! Reading many research papers and analyzing them, there are a lot of assignments to keep out for but they aren't too difficult, just manage your time. Exams were fair and so was her grading! You really learn a lot in this course. Dr. Robertson was very accomodating and one of the best/sweetest professors Ive had!"
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Robertson's class is overall really great. She provides learning objectives which clearly layout what she's looking for on exams and on homework readings. The readings still take a lot of time since the course covers a wide array of topics, but overall it's manageable. I would definitely recommend taking a class with Dr. Robertson."
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Robertson is an amazing professor. There is A LOT of group work so if that isn't your thing, don't take this class. It is a lot of work but you will learn very valuable, applicable things. Two exams (on Sakai) and they were challenging, but she gives SO many opportunities to get extra points to boost your grade. Very accommodating and nice!"
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I LOVED taking this class with Dr. Roberston. She is honestly one of the most caring professors I have ever had. Homework does require a good amount of reading, but this is an intro class so lots of information has to be covered. Her ""Learning Outcomes"" help A LOT for exams. I would definitely recommend this class with Dr. Roberston!!"
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Living legend. I love Sabrina Robertson! I only had her for NSCI693H, which only meets once a week and isn't a traditional class, but she was an excellent mentor/guide. It seems like she is incredibly busy, so props to her for keeping a high standard of excellence across a wide range of activities. Very impressive. Take any class she teaches."
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,Great Professor. Look at the ppt's to help study for tests. There's a TON of reading though.
11,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Robertson is wonderful. She's nice and helpful, but unfortunately, the nature of the course makes it hard to get proper help in office hours bc so many students take 175. There's just not enough time one-on-one if you're really struggling. This is def a weed-out course. It wasn't the hardest thing in the world, but you do have to work for an A."
12,5.0,4.0,0,0,"I wasnt sure I was going to like this class, but I enjoyed it. Dr. Robertson was extremely accommodating this semester. Her exams are very fair, and theres a lot of work to buff your grade in case you do bad on exams. Shes a gem!"
13,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Prof Robertson is very kind and understanding. However, the work load in the class is very heavy, be prepared for lots of quizzes and reading. But the tests weren't too bad as long as you review material and the PowerPoints."
14,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Robertson was an amazing, caring professor. Her lectures were always interesting and understandable. I didn't love the group work element of her class, so that was a bit annoying. She has very clear expectations about what you needed to know for exams, which made it easy to succeed in her class. Unlike most STEM classes, grades are spread out."
15,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Robertson is a caring and knowledgeable professor. Her class is graded by multiple things (quizzes, daily work, polls, exams, etc) which allows one to receive a decent grade. Her lectures are interesting and useful. However, the course becomes more difficult as the semester ends and the lectures will not include all the info on tests."
16,3.0,4.0,0,0,"If you don't want to participate or work primarily in groups, don't take this class. VERY HEAVY GROUP-WORK AND PARTICIPATION!! Two moderately difficult MC exams (make sure you take good notes during journal clubs for them) and the final is a presentation of your group's semester-long research proposal. Every class period there's a lot of pre-work."
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,This course had some conceptually complex material but Dr. Robertson's instruction made them completely digestible. The tests were not that difficult. There were many academic papers for reading but the journal clubs held made them less intimidating/easier to understand. One large group project at the end but a lot of assistance so not bad at all.
18,5.0,3.0,0,0,Dr. Robertson really cares about teaching but she does use active learning techniques. I found her class structure incredibly helpful - she organizes the course and coursework in a logical way that basically gives you all the tools you need to ace the exams and homework. Follow the learning objectives she gives and you're golden.
19,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Robertson is the sweetest professor ever. She truly cares about her students. Her lectures are pretty good, and she's great at explaining concepts. One aspect I didn't like is the little group discussions during class. There is a lot of info in neuro and she gives you all the info you'll need to succeed. Her exams aren't too difficult."
20,5.0,3.0,0,0,Dr. Robertson is the best! She truly cares about all of her students. I was nervous about taking neuroscience but Dr. Robertson was an excellent instructor and clearly communicated to us how we can succeed in her class. It does require a lot of studying - but if you put in the effort it's very manageable!
1,2.0,2.0,0,0,"The class was fine and uninteresting but not very hard if you read the textbook. Going to class was completely useless as he just repeats parts of the textbook you already read, but he takes attendance through quizzes. My TA was fantastic though and graded papers fairly. I just wish class time was more productive as I taught myself everything. "
2,2.0,3.0,0,0,I was disappointed in this class because I was so excited to take it and knew it was going to be an easy A. Roberts was very all over the place during his lectures and got distracted most of the time. Most of the info on the exams was not talked about or just briefly skimmed over in the lecture. There's no way I should get a B- in a 100 level
3,2.0,1.0,0,0,"Class is incredibly easy if you review the lecture slides and skim the textbook. The biggest issue would be the professor. Dr. Roberts, at times, had this aura of ""I'm better than you"" during his lectures. He would also use most of the class to just answer questions, without getting to the content. Overall, take it if you need an easy A."
4,2.0,3.0,0,0,"This class is very lecture heavy so please please please pay attention during his lecture. Hie class his weighted on 3 exams, 2 papers, and participation in his class. READ THE TEXTBOOK! The most beneficial thing to do in his class is to read the textbook. "
5,2.0,4.0,0,0,"This class was based on 3 tests, which was unfair and not based on what we learned what so ever. He isn't a bad lecturer but they were not helpful. Would not recommend unless you want have to. "
6,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Roberts is very easy to listen to and led very interesting lectures. However, his class is oriented around 3 exams and 2 papers. The exams are pretty tough, with a lot of trick questions. You have to read the textbook thoroughly and keep up with the lectures completely. The papers are slight. He does not curve exams."
7,1.0,4.0,0,0,"Tests are hard for no reason. The second test (out of 3) had a 68 average. There are extra credit opportunities (to which I personally went to almost all of them) but not enough to come back from how bad the tests are. Normally an interesting lecture, but would not recommend."
8,1.0,4.0,0,0,"For a 100-level class, this class is unnecessarily hard. The tests are hard to pass because it is based on the lecture slides and he words the exams so tricky. The average test scores were 70s and he does not curve them. Essays are easy but the exams will bring your grade down.
Definitely do not recommend."
9,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof Roberts is very knowledgable, fair, and organized. He's not very flexible or accomodating, but the class is not too hard and the workload is reasonable. Totally fine professor and interesting class. Do the readings and you will be fine."
10,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Class only consisted of three tests including final, two paper, recitation, and poll ev (had so many issues with poll ev technology).  Pretty chill class and getting a good grade is possible.  Keep up with readings and definitely study lecture slides for test.  Try to get Michael Greenberger for your TA; fair grader for papers."
11,4.0,2.0,0,0,"roberts was very nice and a good professor, but he did pollev for attendance. the papers were graded easily, but the tests revolved around the lectures and sometimes included irrelevant and hard-to-remember information. for a 100 level class, however, it was easy and relatively laid back."
12,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Overall, I enjoyed professor Roberts' course. The class grade revolves solely around tests and papers but the more you studied and listened to lectures, the better off you'll be. I would recommend him as he is clearly knowledgeable and engaged in politics, making it easier to not get bored."
13,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Roberts had fairly interesting lectures, but the entire course is 3 tests and 2 papers, with participation taken through PollEv. Tests were extremely difficult and had many trick questions. Averages were in the 70s for all exams and he does not curve. TA's grade the papers, 3 and 7 pages in length. "
14,2.0,3.0,0,0,"Even if you knew all the material, the tests had badly worded questions. He didn't curve the exams even tho our 2nd exam average was low. Pollev was used for attendance but he used it halfway through the semester and many people had problems with it including me. He did not listen to problems and would not curve anything. Would not recommend."
15,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Roberts graded participation through Poll Everywhere, with accuracy counting towards full participation credit. The class consists of lectures, with a few in person multiple choice tests that most people will need to study for. There are two papers for the class that are not very research heavy and not very difficult."
16,3.0,4.0,0,0,"While I really enjoyed Professor Roberts's lectures, his exams are unfair. Specifically, I would do all of the readings and feel as if I had a great grasp on the material, and then receive a 70 on the exams. You are basically graded off of two papers and 3 exams. If it wasn't for his trick questions on tests, I would be giving him 5/5 stars. "
17,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Roberts is very accomplished and intellectual in his field making him a good lecturer and easy to listen to. Readings are assigned but don't stress over them, they are there mainly for context. Grade is based on two papers and two exams so beware. Class was not stressful as long as you put forth effort. Would take again."
18,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Roberts is extremely smart and intellectual about Political Science, so lectures are not boring. Only bad thing about the class is that you are graded on only 4 things, 2 papers and 2 exams."
19,5.0,3.0,0,0,"He taught with another professor for 384, so it's hard to distinguish who graded what, etc. However, his lectures were interesting considering the content. And to respond to the reviews that said he was rude, I don't think he is whatsoever. Solid professor."
20,4.0,3.0,0,0,"I enjoyed this class for it being my first POLI SCI course at UNC. The lectures were long but Professor Roberts did try to gauge discussion throughout the classroom. The readings were very important and were applicable to discussions. Paper was long but attainable, final exam was a little off putting but relevant to current events and class topics."
1,3.0,4.0,0,0,Professor Ryan while nice is kinda disorganized and sporadic.Class moved at an extremely fast pace and the main coding assignments often had questions that not even the ULAs who had the answer key really understood how to reach the correct answer.Assignment guidelines were often confusing and having the right answer doesn't equal full credit
2,3.0,5.0,0,0,"Grading is a complete mystery done by a TA with minimal explanation. At first, the lectures walk you through coding but then you get nothing but definitions. The assignments and final were insanely difficult and he kept falling behind schedule. This meant we had greatly reduced time for the final and it was graded harshly compared to the rubric."
3,3.0,4.0,0,0,"6 assignments and a group final project. Extremely boring and inefficient lectures but easy enough to get through while mastering almost none of the material. He does not explain grading criteria very well so you can get a bad grade out of nowhere. Not difficult, just causes unnecessary amounts of stress and very boring lectures."
4,3.0,4.0,0,0,This class gave me so much anxiety. Assignments were graded harshly and instructions were unclear. 
5,2.0,5.0,0,0, A friend of mine is taking it now and I was reminded of just how tough the class is. It would be helpful if lectures were a bit more useful.  
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof. Ryan is a great professor in terms of learning practical data skillsets in R. I would highly suggest that all POLI students take his two Data in Politics classes (281 & 381), since they develop essential skills for social/political science research. This class also got me into coding, which I never would have expected."
7,4.0,3.0,0,0,"POLI281 is a great class for people who need the QR credit but can't code/do math! Professor Ryan teaches in a way that helps us understand what's going on, at least most of the time. I found the lectures to be redundant so didn't pay attention much, but the groups help. The format of the class does a good job of actually helping us understand."
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Ryan is an amazing professor, he is very receptive to and understanding towards his students. I had previous coding experiences so I didn't have too much struggle with the assignments."
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Def take POLI100 with Prof. Ryan! The only papers are two dope amendment assignment and both midterms + the final are take-home, open book, and open internet. He's a really kind and open-minded guy who won't hold it against you if you disagree with his POV as long as you give solid reasoning. Chill with deadlines and is always cool for extensions."
10,5.0,4.0,0,0,Really nice guy who gives super engaging lectures and is really supportive of students.
11,5.0,4.0,0,0,"He's one of the best! Has a great, intriguing personality, is extremely helpful, and WANTS his students to succeed in the course. No, he won't give you an A if you don't deserve it, but he will spend whatever amount of time it takes working with you to get you there. Definitely take a class with him if you get the chance!"
12,5.0,2.0,0,0,Honestly incredibly underrated. Class has a lot of readings but prof Ryan is fantastic. He challenges you to think critically. A's are not too hard. I learned a ton.
13,5.0,2.0,0,0,Professor Ryan was amazing! Very easy class if you do the readings (which are interesting) and participate in class. There are papers are projects but are easily graded. The tests are open note and they are fair questions that are discussed in some way in class.
14,5.0,3.0,0,1,Professor Ryan is an awesome teacher and is so passionate about what he teaches! He inspires students to dig deeper into class topics and is always super helpful.
15,5.0,4.0,0,0,Professor Ryan is one of my favorite professors of all time! He is an amazing teacher and you will learn so much from his class. He loves what he teaches and really wants his students to succeed. The class is so interesting -- one of my favorite I've taken at Carolina.
16,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Ryan is a fun guy in class. He keeps you engaged but has a problem ending class on time because he's a talker. Midterm and final are only 5 questions, but he does let you use the readings. Research project at the end of the semester is fun but takes time"
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Ryan is a great professor, who manages to make class exciting even when the subject material isn't always exciting. He is super passionate, and will go out of his way to make sure that you understand the material. Great professor, and if you are a Political Science major his class is a must take."
18,4.5,2.0,0,0,"Professor Ryan is a really great teacher. You can tell he knows what he's talking about and he's really good at staying un-biased/not letting his political views affect his teaching. Not too heavy of a workload, the tests and blog posts are very manageable if you put in the time to prepare. I would take this class again, definitely recommend!"
19,5.0,1.0,2,0,"Professor Ryan is a really chill dude and while you don't have to go to class, it will affect your participation grade. He doesn't like tests and as such the few he does give are easy and the class is geared mainly toward learning how to do things rather than learning a bunch of random information. Class was loaded with group projects though. "
20,3.5,3.0,0,0,"He's a nice guy, fair grader, wants the best for you. Really into the blogs which is the better alternative than the NYT thing with Conover. He doesn't get visibly annoyed, although you can tell he's not happy when half the class doesn't show. (Attendance wasn't necessarily mandatory) You get what you put into the class. Take notes."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Sathy is an awesome professor! She cares about her students and makes an effort to see that everyone is on the same page. I wasn't a huge fan of stats at the beginning of the semester, but I grew to love it. She's lenient with the way the class is taught and tries her best to appeal to different learning styles. She's a gem, highly recommend :)"
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I have never taken a stats class before, so I was super nervous coming into this class. Watch her videos before class and do the WS before exams and you are golden. Prior to covid, she was really funny in class. She was also aware of everyone's situations bc of covid. I wish I could take another class with her. 10/10 definitely recommend!"
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"She's such a queen. She really cares about us and was so accommodating with the pandemic. I took AP Stats in high school, but I thought this class was super easy as long as you take the video notes and participate in class. Recitation is kind of pointless, but since its a 4-hour class she doesn't have a choice. Take this class she's the best!!!!!!!"
4,1.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Sathy clearly cares about her students, but often spends too much time making sure you know that. She wastes a lot of class time talking about things that aren't related to stats at all. I also don't feel she understands the material because I took AP stats in high school and learned way more from my high school teacher than I have her."
5,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Sathy is a gem of a professor. She validates the busy schedule of her students and provides so many resources to do well. Instead of readings, you can watch her videos showing the material, you're expected to do this before class. The homework given is reasonable and serves to help you prepare for exams."
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,One of the best professors I have had. So caring and understanding of students. She teaches the material so well and makes it possible for you to succeed in this course.
7,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Sathy is an amazing person who loves her students more than anything and really wants them to succeed. She simplifies the material during lecture, but the exams don't exactly reflect that. The exams have trick questions. The course resources are pretty disorganized which makes it overwhelming."
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Sathy is the best prof I have ever had. She is so kind and has multiple opportunities to receive help outside of class. She actually wanted every student in her class to succeed. Tests and assignments were fair. Learned material by watching videos before class, but they were helpful. She went over confusing material in lecture. Amazing professor."
9,4.0,3.0,0,0,"She makes her own instructional videos that you're required to watch before class. I thought her questions weren't always optimally-worded, but overall, she's a lot better than other professors and is pretty nice."
10,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Sathy is such a caring professor, always available to help you with the material or anything you need. Her lecture videos are the most helpful resource in the class, but attend lecture if you care about participation. The exams can be difficult but lots of practice and review is available. The group project at the end is not hard."
11,4.0,3.0,0,0,"If you attend class, watch the all the videos, and stay on top of the work, this class will be fine for you. Professor Sathy is genuinely cares about how her students do, and is very kind. She teaches statistics in a fun way, and going to class was fun and helpful."
12,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Super caring teacher and if you watch the videos and study before the exams you'll be fine. Stay on top of your work and make sure to review when you can because the material does build on a bit. The material can be a bit tricky at times, but it shouldn't be too hard to get a good grade."
13,5.0,2.0,0,0,loveeee sathy!! honestly one of the most caring professors I've had at unc. she genuinely wants her students to succeed and is very accessible outside class. it is easy to do well in her class if you put in the effort and she gives lots of extra credit opportunities as well! 10/10 recommend
14,5.0,1.0,0,0,"I have seen a lot of unfair comments below. Dr. Sathy is so nice and what requires in this class is just intro-level math (STOR 155) which most people would get a high score as long as they know how to calculate. Also, she gave us so many extra credits opportunities. (totally 6% added to my final grade) Easy A if putting enough efforts into it."
15,2.0,5.0,0,0,This class was harder than it should have been. The professor is nice and caring but her test are tricky!! My advice is to treat it more like a math class because that's what it felt like :(
16,4.0,3.0,0,0,"if you thought Ap Stat was easy, this is basically that but with like two more concepts. Dr. Sathy really does care about her students and does a good job staying on top of it. just watch the videos and you'll keep up."
17,3.0,4.0,0,0,Dr. Sathy is a very nice person in the classroom but she's a different person meeting one on one. The majority of your grade is exams (75%) & they're really challenging and tough. There's lots homework assignments. She does care about her students but I would consider other options before choosing this professor. Also hated the flipped classroom!!
18,4.0,4.0,1,0,"Dr. Sathy is very kind, and it's obvious that she cares about her students. With that being said, I hate her flipped classroom model, and I think that the class is much harder than it needs to be because of that. I would take another class with her if there was no other professor options, but she wouldn't be my first choice."
19,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Kinda a joke. Had to get laser cutter certified, work in groups to build math ""tools"". Did it for the QR gen ed. Easiest FYS on earth. Dr. Sathy is an angel and honestly treated us like 10 year olds, feel like she really enjoyed being with freshman."
20,4.0,5.0,0,0,"While I hated the class that was being taught, Dr. Sathy is a pretty good and caring professor. She gives a lot of homework, but most of it is just so you know how to handle the material. However, her tests are kinda tough so beware."
1,1.0,2.0,0,0,"No slides. Talks TO us for entire lecture. Rambles. Unclear prompts for midterm and final essay (40% each). Due to him being late for finals, allowed us to copy our midterm grade to skip finals. I did."
2,3.0,4.0,0,0,"He is very knowledgable and shares a lot of his experiences. I will say that he does not use powerpoints so it is hard to follow at times. He is a tough grader and the class requires a lot of readings. I have taken many poli classes before, but this one had the most readings. "
3,2.0,2.0,1,0,"If you are a minority or LGBTQ, I would advise strongly against this course. He came across as very transphobic and slightly racist in many lectures. It was a very difficult semester to have to sit through his lectures and him playing ""devils advocate"" in a way that invalidated the identity of many people (LGBTQ people primarily).  "
4,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Searing assigns a lot of readings. You are only graded on participation, midterm, a paper, and final. He is a pretty tough grader + he doesnt post them on Sakai so you are basically clueless about your grade. He is monotonous + no visual aids so it is impossible to focus on his lectures. Please just take notes on your readings for exams!!"
5,3.0,4.0,0,0,"Searing assigns a lot of readings. You are only graded on participation, midterm, and final. He is a pretty tough grader and he doesnt post them on Sakai so you are basically clueless about your grade. He is monotonous and has no visual aids so it is impossible to focus on his lectures. Please just take notes on your readings!!"
6,2.0,4.0,0,0,"Searing is definitely one of the most qualified profs in the dept but his 3 hour long weekly lectures were super dry. My biggest qualm is the lack of clear grading criteria when it comes to the major assignments. Also the class was disorganized, we were constantly behind. A lot of work must go into this class to try and scrounge a good grade."
7,2.0,3.0,0,0,"Searing is an incredibly monotonous lecturer, loves being the devils advocate despite coming off as bigoted/immoral, and is not clear on grading criteria at all. The topic of his class is pretty straight forward, but there is so much reading involved and he is incredibly picky about specifying definition. Take something else if u can - it sucked."
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I LOVED this class! It is super interesting and relevant, but there is a ton of reading. There is a good mix of Professor Searing lecturing and student-led discussions. The mid-term and final both have a lot of weight on your grade, but Professor Searing is a fair grader."
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Searing is obviously invested in the material, and his use of case studies grounds theory in reality. He explains the concepts well, but my favorite part of the class was when he would recount instances in which issues of tolerance arose in his own life, whether in the field doing research or among his friends and family."
10,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Nice professor, wants students to critically think and engage with the subject matter. Really values participation and is usually nice about summarizing readings during class to make sure people understand. Very fair and I would definitely recommend"
11,5.0,3.0,0,0,Dr. Searing is my favorite professor at UNC. He's extremely kind and very knowledgeable. His class is 2.5 hours of just talking but the subject matter is so interesting you won't care. He is great at explaining things. Take his class you won't regret it
12,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Course/material is very interesting, just be prepared to sit through nearly 3 hours of talking with a 15 minute break"
13,5.0,3.0,1,0,Poli 432 is by far the best class I have taken at UNC. I can't recommend Professor Searing high enough. His maymester course consisted of two exams and some participation assignments but the subject matter is so interesting you won't mind participating. The readings aren't too bad and you get to watch a couple films. You won't regret taking this!
1,4.0,3.0,0,0,"He was a good professor. Admitted at the end of the course that it was not his favorite course to teach, but the department made him. Showed movies in class though, gave good lectures and did interesting polls of the class. He also brought his dog in once."
2,4.0,3.0,0,0,I think grade is dependent on TA. Mine was very good. Spinner-Halev is a great lecturer and I enjoyed the class.
3,4.0,5.0,0,0,It was difficult to maintain a good grade in this course because we were only graded by a few things. His TAs are such harsh graders. It is hard to pay attention in his lectures because sometimes the material was just really boring. I do have to say he is such a kind person though. 
4,4.0,3.0,0,0,"This is one of those classes where you get out what you put in; if you don't pay attention/care, it's gonna suck, but if you care and try it's going to be a great class, and it was. JHS is a great professor who is funny, knowledgeable and genuinely cares about his students. The course material is actually pretty fascinating and easy to grasp "
5,2.0,5.0,0,0,Very heavy and difficult. TA were to no help
6,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Just do yourself a favor and run. If you don't have to take his class just don't. He made me rethink my entire major. The class is unnecessarily hard, hard to understand, messy powerpoints and its incredibly hard to follow along. TAs also have very rough and not cohesive grading scales and will explain things to you differently than SH. "
7,3.0,4.0,0,0,"The class if fine if you are taking it as a PWAD requirement, but I wouldn't take it with other reading heavy classes and I wouldn't recommend overall. Personally, I almost never do the readings for my classes but found that I had to take detailed notes on SH's readings in order to succeed on the exams. The papers are graded by TA so that depends. "
8,1.0,5.0,0,0,"Exams were all multiple choice and extremely difficult - you could pretty much argue that every single answer was correct. You had to attend the lectures and pay attention to everything he said; attendance quizzes were given and he purposely made the answers ""wrong"" to figure out who wasn't attending class and taking the quizzes elsewhere. Avoid!"
9,3.0,3.0,1,0,"This class was honestly not terrible but it just felt unorganized. The TAs were difficult graders and the midterms were extraordinarily specific. A lot of reading as well. I think you can do okay in the class but it is a good bit of work so if you can avoid taking this class, I would."
10,4.0,2.0,1,1,"Comments definitely exaggerated. Decent professor who is incredibly flexible. Made the final open note, curved most of the exams, removed questions he thought were too hard. Honestly don't have to study too hard either as long as you do the readings, take notes in class. Some questions were worded weird and essays were graded hard, but still easy."
11,1.0,4.0,1,0,"Jeff is the worst professor I have taken as a senior at UNC. Disorganized, uninteresting lectures. Insane amount of reading for a 200 level class. Exams are multiple choice (in a philo class?) and confusing. Does not seem to care about his students at all. TAs grading papers is always iffy but there were no clear guidelines in this class. "
12,2.0,5.0,1,0,"Don't take this class!!!! Yes, attendance quizzes aren't bad, but exams are poorly written and are confusing to take. You read a book by Walzer on top of 20+ other philosophers papers and try to connect them, and Spinner does not help at all. Overall, its around 40+ pages of reading per class so beware. Papers were graded insanely harshly too."
13,4.0,3.0,1,1,"The only issue I had with this class is that it was my introduction to philosophical writing. Some test questions can be application based, but are not difficult as long as you make an attempt to understand the readings. He lowered the weight of our worst test and made the final open note. Don't get the hate for Jeff, just understand this is UNC.
"
14,2.0,5.0,0,0,"Very interesting topics covered in class, but a lot of the content covered on exams were upright confusing. A lot of the questions seemed to be there to confuse you and leave you very unsure. Grading (TAs), especially for papers, was often very harsh and it was also hard to know what was required of you. Interesting class, would not take again. "
15,1.0,5.0,1,0,His lectures are very disorganized. He talks fast and has very little information on his slides. He gives difficult multiple choice exams that were tricky but I feel like short answer would be better to truly show mastery over the material and not trick us. But when we asked him about doing that he said that would be too much for the TAs to grade. 
16,2.0,5.0,1,0,"The lectures are not organized. The readings are confusing, and the exams are even worse (vague questions with no clear answers). I attended every lecture (because of his attendance quizzes) and read every reading, but, even with studying days prior, these exams are very difficult and not made for students to get an A. Good luck taking this class. "
17,5.0,1.0,1,3,I dont know why people are leaving bad reviews. This class is super easy all you have to do is take notes during lecture and you're fine. the final was literally open note and open book. super interesting material too
18,4.0,2.0,1,4,"The other reviews are exaggerated. Quiz and exam questions are clear and direct. You just need to understand and re-read the readings at least once to get an A. His lectures only have a loose progression, so write down everything he says and organize it on your own time. TAs grade the essays harshly, so bring your outline to office hours. "
19,2.0,5.0,1,0,The content is interesting and Spinner is a good professor but his grading doesn't make any sense. It feels like TAs just give random grades with little feedback. And the exam questions are meant to trick you. You have to be in class. You don't get out what you put in. 
20,1.0,3.0,1,0,"His lectures are mostly just repeating what the readings said. He values a traditional classroom experience over accessibility and the health of the students. The exams were multiple choice (in a philosophy class?), and they're made to trick you. The first two just expected you to memorize the readings. Don't take this class."
1,3.0,3.0,0,0,"I didn't appreciate how the professor would often ignore comments he didn't agree with, which hindered productive discussion. Furthermore, he often played the devil's advocate and came across as bigoted and ignorant when it came to systemic issues. While he was alright, he wasn't really my cup of tea."
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Steiner was wonderful, and this class was great. I went in knowing little to nothing about European politics and came out with an abundance of knowledge. He has a discussion-based format, so come to class prepared (he does occasionally cold-call). Overall, if you are interested in European politics, definitely take this class."
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Steiner is awesome, even with a 2.5 hour long class, it doesn't get boring and the discussion based format is excellent. He always challenged us to think about every perspective and consider different sides of a situation, I learned a lot in this class. He is a fair grader and the group paper is annoying to coordinate but very doable."
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Prof Steiner respects students and encourages critical thinking!! He does ask for participation and perhaps a deeper level of thinking than students are prepared for, but I felt that he does a good job of balancing high expectations with a work-load that is not overwhelming. "
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Great professor. Very engaged and excited about the material. A lot of reading, but great course overall. You learn a lot"
6,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Incredible professor! Be prepared to spend time on the readings - class is discussion-based and lectures are few and far between, so understanding the readings is crucial to earning participation credit. 3 papers and 1 group presentation/paper instead of exams. Tough grader but fair and grades anonymously - feedback made me a much better writer."
7,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Steiner is a very caring and engaging professor! The class is quite difficult and requires a lot of reading. There are several pop quizzes, but they don't count for most of the grade. He cares about how his students feel and is a fair grader. "
8,1.0,4.0,0,0,The class wasn't bad per se. It just was a lot of reading and the lectures were drawn out and long.
9,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Steiner is the best! He's knowledgeable, interesting, and engaging. Classes are largely discussion-based. There is a decent amount of reading, but it's all worth it. Grades consist of a midterm paper, a group paper, and a final paper along with discussion posts and weekly reading quizzes. Not too hard of a grader. Take his class!"
10,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Steiner is a great teacher! He cares about his students and actively tries to include them in class discussions. He does require you to read multiple times a week and participation is mandatory in class. He is a slightly tough grader, but overall it was a great class. Highly recommend!"
11,5.0,4.0,0,0,Steiner is such a great teacher! I really enjoyed his class you just have to make sure you read the materials that are assigned outside of class. There are 3 essays and 1 group essay and he grades those pretty tough but its a great class to be in. 
12,5.0,3.0,0,0,Incredible professor. Really cares about his students and is engaging. Take his class!
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Best prof by far so far at UNC. Truly cares about the students and the subject and wants students to learn/excel. Grading was tough but fair and his feedback on each paper made me a much better writer. If you put in the effort, you will take a lot from this course, if you just want easy credit, there are way better options."
14,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Steiner is really excellent. He makes an already engaging class even better. Great feedback, understanding, easygoing, smart, etc etc. POLI can easily be boring but he picks great readings to discuss in the next class so it was much more engaging than my other POLI classes. Take a class with Steiner if you can!"
15,5.0,3.0,0,0,"this class was very discussion heavy and there are few grades, with the majority of grades relying on papers (in which steiner can be a harsh grader). there are many readings, all of which require a forum post. this class is very writing-heavy but incredibly informative."
16,5.0,4.0,0,0,Best professor I've had thus far. I learned so much from this class. A good amount of reading but all the articles are interesting and are discussed thoroughly in class. Papers are graded tough but it helps you become a better writer. Definitely not easy but it is so worth it. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!
17,5.0,2.0,0,0,Really fun class as long as you do the readings & engage in discussions. Prof Steiner is accommodating & fosters a great classroom atmosphere.
18,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Steiner is the best teacher I have had yet. He truly cares about all of his students and wants everyone to feel comfortable to participate in group discussions. Each class began with an icebreaker then went into discussion that was based on a reading from the previous night. Essay grading is hard, but fair. Take his class if you can!!"
19,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Hands-down my favorite professor at UNC! I have never been compelled to write a review before, but I appreciate his class so much that I am. He goes out of his way to make sure everyone understands the material and he doesn't lecture, instead we discuss the (short) readings in class and he tries really hard to build a community in the online class."
20,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Steiner was one of my favorite professors at UNC. He's an incredibly interesting individual, and he loves talking to students one-on-one. Put in the work and you will do well in his classes."
1,5.0,2.0,0,0,She's super sweet and flexible and the class isn't bad! I found the midterm to be a little more challenging than the final. Didn't get perfect scores on assignments but it was still enough to get an A. The content was very interesting and useful to know. She's also super open to feedback throughout the class which I think is very respectable. 
2,5.0,2.0,0,0,Amazing lectures and class activities! Gives great feedback on assignments that are actually interesting and helpful. Really puts in time and effort to make a good classroom experience. Values everyone's opinions when it comes to discussions. Would totally give a 6/5 if possible. Please put in effort and don't just go for an easy A though.
3,5.0,1.0,0,0,She is one of the best you can find at UNC. Very kind and supportive. Grade is not harsh. Do first year seminar with her. You will be fine. Best experience i have in the 23 spring.
4,4.0,2.0,0,0,Professor Su was great. Her lectures are interesting and makes the class really engaging. The papers are worth a good amount of your grade but the class is pretty easy. 
5,5.0,2.0,1,0,"You can't go wrong taking this class! Dr. Su is extremely nice. Her lectures were very informative and easy to follow, and the material is very relevant and important. No presentations, one semester-long paper, quick class assignments, and relevant and usually quick readings!"
6,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Professor Su was super kind and truly cared about the success of her students. She gave amazing lectures but participation was not mandatory. In class assignments throughout the semester, so attendence required. Super easy work and small reflections every 2 weeks. One big paper throughout the semester, was not too overwhelming. Open note exams."
7,5.0,2.0,2,0,Professor Su is a sweetheart and super understanding. She made this semester better for me. There's a lot of discussion within the class. There was also a big final paper but we worked on it throughout the semester which made it easier. There was only a midterm and final.
8,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Prof Su is such a sweetheart. Literally one of the kindest people I have met. This class is super interesting and fairly easy. You have 5 assignments, all equally weighted. Attendance isnt mandatory but you will miss the in class activities if you dont show and those are easy points. I never read the book and still got an A. Highly recommend!"
9,5.0,2.0,1,0,"Dr. Su is so sweet. Doesn't give pop quizzes, just simple assignments in class. Always welcomes participation, great lecturer. Loves to connect with her students. Open to any suggestions to improve her class. Exams are pulled from slides. Assignments are unannounced and count as attendance. No makeups but the lowest 2 are dropped."
10,4.0,1.0,1,0,"Dr. Su is an extremely kind professor (she also has a super cute family). The class was easy enough, although a large portion of our grade depended on a single term-paper. Paying attention isn't nearly as important as studying her study guide and reading the texts. She was generous enough to round my grade up without my even asking!"
1,4.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Thiele values straightforward exam/quiz questions, so do not worry about him trying to trick you. Grading criteria is extremely clear, and the slides contain everything you need to know. Go to class so you can ask questions - he checks in frequently to see if students have any confusion. "
2,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Professor Thiele is great. While his lectures may not be the most interesting, he more than makes up for it in communication and exams. They were never unfair, generally were questions that you'd know how to answer if you were in lecture, and were very time-forgiving. If you're in neuroscience, he's one of the best professors you could have."
3,4.0,3.0,0,0,I just want to point out that the there is another Dr. Tod Thiele at the University of Toronto who also teaches neuroscience and I find that hilarious.
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Class is pretty straightforward and as long as you do the assigned readings and show up to class you'll be successful. Tests are legit just what's on the PowerPoint slides so if you study those before exams you'll be alright. Chill guy and cares about what he does, and is happy to answer any questions. I really enjoyed his class."
5,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Awesome professor, 11/10 recommend."
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Thiele explained all concepts clearly and was always willing to answer questions. He undoubtably understands that learning a great deal can be accomplished without making the class difficult, and never tested on trick questions. He often incorporated real life examples so students could better understand and apply the concepts. Extremely kind"
7,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Great guy. Could get a little boring because of repeated topics and constant lectures, but in the end everything he talks about ends up being on the test so it's worth it. Three big exams and one journal, lots of mini quizzes. Easy A if you show up to class and study notes the night before test."
8,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Nice person and good professor who is very passionate about his work and incorporates that into his lectures. Tests are mostly from his slides, not the book, so if you go to class and study the slides, you should do well on tests. Lectures can get a little tiring after a while because of the material being covered, but a nice, easy class overall."
9,5.0,1.0,0,0,"Phenomenal professor! Lectures could tend to get dry, but his uses his research to teach and made it interesting.  He pulls tests directly from slide material, super straightforward.  You have to show up to class, but other than that, it's an easy A"
10,4.0,3.0,0,0,"I didn't have any problems with him. Lecture attendance is definitely required: all tests are based on the slides from the lecture. The class itself wasn't too boring, and he was very clear about grading. Each assignment took some work but not any more than any other class. We had one bigger project, but had all semester to do it. A good prof"
1,3.0,3.0,0,0,"This is a bio anth class that is very manageable for people who don't get science lol. The tests can be a little difficult & the assignments a bit tedious, but otherwise an ok class. If you don't actually SEE/HEAR the lecture, you're going to miss a lot. Prof. Thompson is very considerate and caring though, she's not trying to make the class hard."
2,4.0,3.0,0,0,"This was my second time taking her and I find the whole content to be interesting in whole. The downside is that she can go through lectures real quick and exams take longer than expected, but in the end, everything is open note. Maymester was a challenge, so I would recommend taking at a regular semester. Overall the content alone was interesting."
3,4.0,3.0,0,0,"This class could have been more interesting than it was in my opinion. However, Dr. Thompson is really nice and understanding. There is a group project that is simple and headache free. Take the course!"
4,3.0,2.0,1,0,"Dr. Thompson and the TAs for this class are super nice, but I wish we had deeper discussions about issues in lectures/recitations. This class has a lot of biology and not as much anthropology as I anticipated, and the level of complexity (from the discussion in class to the group projects assignments) kinda reminded me of high school"
5,3.0,3.0,0,0,"A really nice professor. Exams were critically graded, so it is important that you do the readings. Lectures were interesting, though I felt the delivery was a bit boring."
6,3.0,4.0,1,0,"Thompson is very knowledgeable but feel like she often had trouble connecting with students in a way that helped us to learn. As much as I wanted to be interested in the class, lectures were mostly just her rambling. Most of the grades were subjective and was largely determined by the TA you had. I liked the class and would take it again but ehh."
7,3.0,4.0,1,0,"I really enjoyed Professor Thompson's lectures; they were very detailed and thought-provoking. However, I did pretty badly on both the midterm and the final even though I studied a lot and focused on the review guide. I would say her tests are harshly graded for sure and I never fully understood why I got points off."
8,4.0,4.0,0,0,"Dr. Thompson is absolutely brilliant. Her lectures were always engaging, clear, and purposeful. I will say that grading criteria was really unclear at times. This is definitely not her fault, but the class is enormous, which can make discussions difficult."
9,4.0,3.0,1,0,"Prof. Thompson was kind and engaging, and I enjoyed her class. She assigned weekly readings, though her lecture slides alone sufficed. We worked on 3 case studies, a course project, a midterm, and a final. Tips: Always ask TA's for context on any assignment, because they grade differently, and study hard for the midterm - many take it for granted."
10,4.0,2.0,0,0,Great lecturer and really cares about the subject material. The group project is 40% of whole grade .
11,2.0,2.0,1,0,"Dr. Thompson is an incredibly mediocre professor at best. She honestly just reads from the slides and offers little chance for participation. Most people in class don't pay attention. The case studies assigned are patronizingly trivial, yet the TA's have the gall to grade all assignments and tests very harshly. Easy A, but you won't learn much."
12,5.0,2.0,2,1,Dr. Thompson is one of my favorite professors at UNC. Her lectures were always engaging and inspiring. Going to lecture/recitation is important due to lots of group work. I found myself looking forward to this class and appreciated how the course content flowed. Fair grading and expectations were always clearly laid out. Would definitely recommend!
13,1.0,3.0,5,8,Amanda is a utterly horrible human being. Grades are determined by TA's and they grade hard on exams for no reason. When you ask why points are taken off Amanda can't explain why and becomes snippy. You have to keep the same group for both projects which can be unfortunate. Grades are also not returned in a timely manner.
14,2.0,4.0,3,1,"Dont bs this class. You may take it for an easy credit, but if you get a bad group for the project it can be a determining factor in final grading. Reading is not necessary. Just study all the slides and have a study group 2 days before the exam and you should be good. Also the TAs grade a lot harder than necessary, but it works out."
15,4.0,2.0,1,1,"She is very knowledgeable and tends to lecture very fast, so taking notes can be a struggle. Class consisted of case study papers, student presentation and discussions, and a final, independent group research paper. As long as you read the articles, participate, and can write well, an A should be pretty easy"
16,5.0,3.0,1,0,"Dr. Thompson is an amazing teacher! ANTH 319 provides a great overview of global health issues. If you already had exposure to global health from other courses this class may not provide much new info. I had taken many public health and biological/medical anthro classes before 319, so I barely read or studied at all. Still a great class!"
17,5.0,3.0,2,1,"Dr. Thompson is the most eloquent lecturer I've ever had, and she is obviously super knowledgable and passionate about the subject. Very approachable outside of class as well. 2 exams were as expected, and the recitation project is a real grade-booster. Readings not necessary to get a good grade. Not a hard class, but very interesting!"
18,5.0,3.0,1,0,"Her lectures are really engaging. There were 3 case studies due this semester, but the lowest grade gets dropped. The tests were more demanding that other courses I have taken in the past. They were all short answer/essay type questions. The biggest assignment in the class is the group project that is completed in recitation sections."
19,5.0,3.0,1,0,"She's such an amazing lecturer. I've heard several people say she's their favorite prof at UNC. She's very approachable and helpful after class. Group projects are easy and done in recitation. If you are interested in the topics and follow the requirements you'll do well on assignments, but tests are graded harshly. Attendance not mandatory but go."
20,4.0,3.0,0,1,"Lectures were engaging and interesting. Learned a lot about global health and social factors. Class consisted of 2 group projects, 2 case studies, midterm and final. Projects were completed during recitation so that's a plus. Midterm and final aren't bad if you study but demanding in the time given."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Unah is very passionate about constitutional law and the Supreme Court. He is an amazing professor, and all of the readings are case studies. I highly recommend taking this class if you're passionate about the supreme court or case precedent. Many of the people who expressed dislike for the class were people simply taking it for a credit."
2,4.0,2.0,0,0,"I love this man. While he is pretty disorganized, his tests are fair and he is very passionate about the subject matter. I am a super type A person and still felt that I learned a lot even with the disorganization. He is so funny and really cares about his students. "
3,1.0,2.0,0,0,"While the material was interesting, Professor Unah was not a great instructor. He was late, disorganized, and unclear. Lectures consisted of unrelated tangents and opportunities to flex his ego. At times it seemed like he was more interested in trying to prove how cool he was instead of properly preparing us for exams/assignments. I would avoid."
4,2.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Unah as a person is fantastic, but as an educator he is not great. He's clearly smart and empathetic, but his disorganization, fixation on certain topics, and tendency to ramble meant some classes covered absolutely nothing of substance. The tests and papers are also surprisingly difficult. Nice man, but I'd find someone else if you can."
5,1.0,4.0,0,0,"Don't want to disrespect the professor but can't advise anyone to take this class Professor was often late to class, weeks behind the syllabus, never replied to emails, after the final a paper from October has not been graded now December no idea what grade I will get. Quizzes in class random, numerous spelling mistakes in the final. etc etc. "
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"I don't know why all of the reviews for Dr. Unah are so bad, I think he's funny. I took POLI 416 with him during the Fall semester of 2022 and I loved him and this class. If you do the readings and take notes on the textbooks, you can easily get A's on quizzes and exams. "
7,2.0,3.0,0,0,Unah is a very kind person and the content he taught was fascinating. It was difficult to be in this class because of his lack of structure in class meetings. Many class periods went wasted discussing meaningless things which led us to be very behind on the syllabus. Tests are weighed VERY heavily with the final being almost half the grade.
8,1.0,3.0,0,0,"An absolute clown of a professor. Completely disorganized and the students suffer from his lack of professionalism. Gives a quiz 5 minutes before the final exam because he forgot to give it to us when we had an appropriate amount of time for it. Doesnt respond to students comments or concerns, shows up late, rambles, terrible content. horrendous."
9,2.0,3.0,0,0,The most unorganized class I have taken. The class was consistently confused and was given little to no guidelines on how to prepare for anything. The tests were often filled with random trivia and the schedule set in the syllabus was completely inconsistent with what occurred. Overall I am let down because the content of the class is interesting.
10,3.0,1.0,0,0,He gave a quiz 5 minutes before the final exam. That's all.
11,2.0,3.0,0,0,Professor Unah is really nice but horribly disorganized. We were consistently over a month behind. His tests are hard and he often will put random questions on there that he never spoke about and expects us to know the answers. He also doesn't really budge on any of his test questions even when they're obviously unclear and not written well.
12,2.0,2.0,0,0,"Unah is nice and cares about his students, the material was interesting, and exams were straightforward. Not sure if it was the online format, but I never knew where we were on the syllabus or what we were supposed to have read for that day. We also barely received guidance for our term papers. Maybe this class would have been better in person."
13,2.0,2.0,0,0,"Disorganized to the point that its inconsiderate of your time as a student. Almost two weeks have passed since the final and a grade has yet to be submitted, which could affect my GPA if it is not changed soon. Unreachable by email, unclear instruction during class time. Avoid."
14,2.0,3.0,0,0,"Unah was probably the most disorganized professor I've had at UNC. We were given few guidelines about our final papers, and we ended the semester really far behind the syllabus because he got distracted a lot and spent 4 classes on statistical analysis. he also never responded to emails, including to confirm the date of our final exam."
15,2.0,3.0,0,0,"Not sure if it's the online format or what, but quite honestly, Dr. Unah is not great. I have never met anyone in my adult life that wears their responsibilities on their sleeve like Unah. He's always late, never prepared, cold calls during class, doesn't offer helpful feedback, and gives pop quizzes worth a good portion of your grade."
16,2.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Unah, Im sure, is a wonderful person. However, he is the most unorganized, uninspiring lecturers Ive ever had. The textbooks are mandatory but dont bother reading because hes just going to copy word for word haphazardly slapped on a PowerPoint for our viewing pleasure. Would not recommend."
17,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Unah is an amazing professor-caring, knowledgeable, smart. His only flaw is organization; he tends to get excited and spends too much time on certain topics and neglects others. However, he does account for this in exams and quizzes. Do the readings, come to class, you'll be fine. A pretty lenient grader too!"
18,4.0,4.0,0,0,"The only reason I don't rate Unah a ""5"" is because of his organization and timeliness. He is a gem of a guy, but sometimes is unprepared and neglects to provide timely feedback for your grades. I didn't really know where I stood in the class until final grades came out. All said, Unah is still a good prof. Very knowledgable. Very enthusiastic."
19,4.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Unah is the most caring professor I've had at Carolina. He genuinely cares about his students and the material he teaches. However, he is incredibly unorganized. He often came to class not knowing what the topic on the syllabus was. I wouldn't recommend this for a freshman, but definitely take one of his classes at some point!"
20,3.0,3.0,0,0,"Unah's super kind and a whiz on the material. But we got off topic all the time. We weren't tested on stuff we didn't cover tho. Getting good test grades is key to your grade here (midterm 33%, final 37%). Multiple choice is hard to study for, often trivia stuff. Need to ace the short answers. Take good notes and stay ready for occasional quizzes!"
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Vachudova is the best professor/teacher I have ever been taught by.  She always engages and prepares for class in an expert-like fashion. It is clear she knows what she is doing. Especially having to deal with students who never want to do the work, anything would be too hard for those looking for an easy A. 100% would recommend! "
2,3.0,3.0,0,0,"She is kind, a little disoriented, but wants to be there for her students. Has a lot of office hours and wants you to come. Very few grades so you have no idea where you stand until like the last week of class. Takes forever to get grades back as well. She did grade pretty leniently though. Lots and lots of reading for homework, so be prepared."
3,5.0,3.0,0,0,"MAV is one of my favorite professors I've had - so funny, caring and kind! Her lectures are straight-forward, engaging and always include current events which keep the class up to date. 1 big research paper, 2 midterms, final exam and participation make up the grade. Not too hard to get an A, but you need to definitely put in effort!"
4,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Vachudova is the best prof. I've had at UNC - coming from a Senior. She cares greatly about the subject matter, her students, and her students' success in and out of the classroom. She gives engaging lectures (participation in them a must for this course) and is easily available outside of lecture to talk about class or even just life."
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Dr. Vachudova is a wonderful person and a great professor. She gives great feedback on assignments and is understanding about any outside circumstances. While lectures can sometimes be unclear, she provides good study guides and interesting, open-ended questions on tests. I would 100% take a class with Dr. Vachudova again."
6,5.0,2.0,0,0,Dr. Vachudova is an amazing person and is super accessible outside class. She has a lot of knowledge but is willing to indulge student curiosities and questions in class. She genuinely cares about her students and their learning. I would 100% take a class with her again!
7,5.0,3.0,1,0,"Pre Waring: Grading is slow, but the class is great. I loved her lectures, Prof V is super knowledgeable on the topic. Lecture slides are detailed but attendance is mandatory. Grading is specific and takes awhile but gives great feedback. If you do the readings, and go to office our for paper help you will be fine! Overall learned a lot"
8,1.0,3.0,0,3,"Dr. Vachudova is a very nice lady and is lenient with deadlines. If you're looking to actually learn about Europe, take a different class. The way she taught this class did not make any sense and I don't think she really cared much about it either. She never provides feedback on assignments even though the requirements were always confusing."
9,5.0,4.0,0,0,"Prof. Vachudova is the best. She truly cares about her students and will easily work with you if you ask. Reading/workload is what you'd expect from a 400-level class, but she makes it not a drag. She is clearly an expert on East/Central Europe -- definitely take her if you have any interest in the region."
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof. Vachduova was a great professor who's super passionate and knowledgeable about the material she teaches. Super interesting books/readings combined with easy-to-follow lectures made for a very easy class experience, even when we transitioned to online learning. Plus, she's super kind and helped make the class as easy as possible."
11,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Vachudova is a great teacher. Super funny, super chill, and loves to tell stories. Pretty easy grader, and loves to give advice. 10/10 teacher!"
12,5.0,3.0,0,0,"AWESOME. Love Professor Vachudova. She is one of the most, if not the most qualified professors I have, and am sure will ever have at UNC. She is witty, kind, and an expert on all things East and Central Europe. Would recommend to anyone!"
13,2.5,2.0,1,0,"Super nice lady, but she is so disorganized and unclear. There are pop quizzes on the most random things, she gives HUGE amounts of reading plus emails you tons of additional articles, and the tests are unclear. I got a C- on the midterm but still managed to get a B+ in the class, so can't complain. TA's do most of the grading"
14,4.5,3.0,0,0,"Really interesting class material, however I hate the grading percentages. Two exams, a few pop quizzes, and recitation participation. The exams and quizzes are either based on random things she finds important or from ridiculously long readings assigned every week. The TA's do all the work in this class but Milada is a good lecturer."
15,3.0,2.0,0,0,"She typically misses several days of class due to research abroad but due to her lack of attendance, she grades pretty easy-- she'll even tell you so."
16,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Excellent Professor; she makes the subject so interesting and fun! She also has great stories to tell of her childhood in the former Yugoslavia.  Very approachable as well and fair on her exams.  I was not surprised by any of the content.  Overall, one of the best political science professors I had at UNC."
17,2.0,2.0,1,1,"What a worthless class.  It's pure history rather than politics.  Vachudova is a nice woman, but she teaches in generalizations and stereotypes, lecture is pointless, and the TAs do all the work in recitation.  Exams are vague and don't test knowledge, rather your understanding of what she wants you to say.  This course is a complete waste of time."
18,4.0,3.0,0,0,"never had poli sci before this class. it wasn't bad considering i'm not the best at politics/history. she's generally late. very helpful if you go see her. i was confused until the exam (which is all short answer) but she gives you credit for putting something down as long as it isn't stupid. try to keep up w/ readings, go to class!"
19,5.0,3.0,0,0,Wonderful teacher.  Very knowledgeable about the subject matter.  Makes things interesting.
20,5.0,3.0,0,1,"Great teacher, entertaining and personable with great stories.  I learned alot too!"
1,2.0,4.0,1,0,"The most inaccessible professor I have ever had. Sent over ten extremely important emails throughout the semester and never once got a response. Even when it concerned mistakes in grading and time sensitive questions. Nice guy, passionate about teaching, but his inability to respond or communicate is not fair to his students. "
2,4.0,3.0,0,0,Ecstatic about course material wants students to engage. Very understanding. The class was a bit out of my comfort zone because the second half of the class is a simulation of ancient Athens including everyone giving a speech. A lot of people get into the simulation. it's not hard it just can be difficult if you're shy to get into character. 
3,2.0,4.0,3,0,"Do not take. The second half of the class is a simulation, which is cool, but it is extremely disorganized and your grade will pay the price. Also, most of the class suffered from his extremely vague and random choice of questions for the midterm. Grade does not reflect how much you know or how hard you worked, which is unfair. "
4,2.0,4.0,3,0,"Very nice and funny but extremely disorganized and difficult to reach outside of class. Respect him a lot as a person, but I do not recommend taking a class with him simply because of these issues. "
5,5.0,2.0,0,0,"I had Professor Weidenfeld for Poli 59 and it was a great experience. Not only does he create a classroom environment that is fun to be in, but he also does a great job at teaching the material. Grades in the class are unfortunately on few things, but he is a generous grader and you should be fine if you do the reading. Overall, highly recommend."
6,4.0,2.0,0,0,I don't like theory classes but Weidenfeld made this one bearable and even interesting to a degree. His lectures were always thought-provoking and the assignments & quizzes were pretty easy. The historical simulation/roleplay in the last 6 weeks was super unconventional in a fun way. Make sure you understand the theories and you'll be good to go.
7,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Weidenfeld is an incredible and engaging lecturer who made me want to attend class. None of the assignments were too hard and the exams were very fair. However, grading is up to the TA's so keep that in mind. Just attend  and pay attention class, understand the readings, and put thought/effort in your assignments and you will be fine!"
8,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof Weidenfeld uses some unconventional but highly entertaining methods in some of his courses, including a complicated role-playing historical simulation in this course. The latter half of the class was some of the most fun I've ever had in college, and his encouragement of engagement and questions in the lecture half was great. Would recommend."
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Weidenfeld is an awesome teacher to have. He is super passionate about the material and has engaging lectures. Really hated the content of POLI 271 so I didn't like the class, but Weidenfeld as a professor is awesome!"
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,Whether you are a poli major or not you HAVE to take this class with Weidenfeld. I took this class as a freshman and it still is my favorite class I have ever taken at UNC. Weidenfeld is so funny and helpful with the simulation. You basically become the constitutional convention and is seriously is the most fun!! 
11,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Professor Weidenfeld's class was engaging and entertaining and I really enjoyed the way he set up the simulation. The workload wasn't terrible - two papers, two speeches, four quizzes - but quizzes can be tough. Be prepared to participate in class and read a lot of political theory, but the class is really fun overall and I would take it again."
12,4.0,2.0,0,0,"So chill, amazing guy. Reminds me of Hamilton debate kid class. If you like history, absolutely take it. Readings are kinda difficult, but he gives notes in class. 2 papers and 2 speeches total, not too bad. Never knew what was going on, but it was still fine. Hard quizzes but they are online and answers on quizlet, let us take some w/ groups."
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Weidenfeld is the best professor I've had at UNC. This class simulated the French and American Revolutions and everyone played a character. I was scared that it would be a lot of work, and it is (a lot of reading, political thought, and meetings outside of class) but it's fun and not unmanageable. Take it!"
14,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Echoing other students here, the man makes the cumbersome world of Political Theory deeply enjoyable! He makes dated philosophizing relevant today, and helps guide ones imagination to the meat of the info, so we may critique it better. My only complaint is hes so good he seems like hes juggling numerous responsibilities at times. Still love him."
15,5.0,4.0,0,0,"I loved Dr. Weidenfeld's class. I was a freshman STEM major in a POLI class full of seniors so I felt a bit out of my element but ultimately was happy. Fun game structure. There isn't much to grade (3 papers and two or three exams) but that's it, so beyond that, you work as much as you want for your role. Teaches you much more beyond poli sci"
16,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Great professor who is passionate about the material and an outgoing guy. The readings are challenging and he doesn't use PowerPoints. You'll have to be able to pick up on larger themes and ideas instead of details. The simulation was fun and a great way to conclude the course. I recommend this course, the stuff you learn will apply to your life."
17,5.0,3.0,0,0,I love Professor Weidenfeld! You can clearly tell that he is incredibly passionate about the materials he teaches. I am taking this 400+ class as a freshman but I really loved it! He makes everything fun! My best online learning experience! The exams are very doable. The midterm paper was challenging but only the second draft is graded so its fine
18,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Coming from a Poli major, prof. Weidenfeld is probably the best teacher in the department. His lectures are engaging, personal, and entertaining. He's very knowledgeable about the material and he solicits and respects different interpretations of it. The workload and grading are intimidating at first but really are on par with most other courses."
19,5.0,1.0,0,0,"This was probably my favorite class at UNC! Dr. Weidenfeld really cares about what hes teaching and makes it fun. I thought the simulation was going to be a little intimidating at first, but it was actually pretty chill and hilarious. If you have a chance to take this class, do it!"
20,5.0,3.0,0,0,"LOVED this class! Political theory is tough, but Weidenfeld really breaks it down and makes it easy to understand. Very engaging lecturer and super interactive class. Papers and exams are tough, but if you go to office hours, do the readings, and go to class, you'll be fine."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Very nice, clear grading criteria, very organized, few papers, a midterm, occasional attendance check ins, group interview project. Class is half lecture half discussion/group work. Only complaint is some of the grading can we arguably a little weird, but still 10/10 recommend taking the class. "
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,Kate is highly educated and skilled in Sociology topics. I highly enjoyed taking Social Stratification with her. The class was highly discussion based and I enjoyed the relationships I build with peers in the class. I learned so much and really enjoyed her class.
3,5.0,2.0,0,0,"She cares for students a lot. There are some essays, but she is a fair grader. Midterm is kinda challenging, and a lot of articles need to be read, but no final, and solid amount of extra credit. She is respectable and caring.  "
4,4.0,2.0,0,0,"She definitely cares about student success and mental health. She was very open to suggestions, catered to student's interests, and allowed for students to be creative in their writing. The readings were sometimes long and boring, but overall fairly interesting class. "
5,5.0,3.0,0,0,"She gives a lot of readings, but if you read them the class should be a breeze. I learned a lot this semester from her. We had 2 writing assignments, 2 quizzes, an op-ed, we had to post a reading question, and the final slot was used to present our op-ed to a small group. It is an interesting class and as long as you do what your told, you'll pass."
6,5.0,3.0,0,0,"LOVED the class and Dr. Weishaar! I'd take all of her classes in a heartbeat. She's approachable, readings make sense, and class discussion is genuinely interesting + engaging. She definitely gives us everything we need to succeed. The major papers are graded pretty gently, usually by the TA."
7,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof Weishaar is very knowledgeable and caring. The class and readings can get a little dry at times, but if you participate it's easier to understand the material and not get bored. This is an easy class as long as you pay attention and skim readings, no notes needed."
8,5.0,1.0,0,0,This class covered many interesting topics and Professor Weishaar made lectures enjoyable by giving students time to discuss and make comments. Workload was super light other than readings before class that were easy to skim and the final.
9,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Professor Weisshaar is well knowledgeable in what she teaches and and follows the syllabus pretty well. There are rubrics for all assignment that is followed completely and is given prior. The textbook is free and while there are quite a few readings assigned every class, they're easy to skim. Few papers and final is a presentation on final paper."
10,5.0,2.0,0,0,Kate is an amazing professor. Very considerate. She encourages discussion and participation in class. There are quite a few readings but you can just skim them. No final exam but a final paper/presentation. Pretty easy class and an amazing professor.
11,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Kate is such a sweetheart! I loved her class and it was definitely manageable. Not a lot of intensive work at all, and 3 essays including the final! Please please take a course with her if you want a relatively easy class but also want to learn a lot. Thanks Kate! :)"
12,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Prof Weisshaar is so understanding of students' situations outside of class. She gives pretty interesting readings and is a good lecturer. I thought she did a good job of delivering the material respectfully and made an effort to include intersectionality and transgender stories in her material. It's also a pretty easy class, especially online."
13,5.0,3.0,0,0,Great Class. Kate is awesome! Had a few small papers and an op-ed. She is good with grading. Participation is definitely important. Quizzes on some of the readings sometime. Great class!
14,5.0,4.0,0,0,"This class is very interesting, we cover many different topics and complete a few papers. The class is heavy on readings but it is manageable."
15,5.0,3.0,1,0,"Professor was incredibly understanding (pandemic and personal). She cares about your mental health just as much as your work. She will check up on you if you have a missing assignment and she grades by rubric. Although I feel she could have used more intersectionality, she did use studies and we discussed race a few times. Interesting class!"
16,4.0,2.0,0,0,"I took this class for a gen ed requirement and I'm really glad I did. Dr. Weisshaar is a very nice professor who goes out of her way to explain content in lectures and is always accessible outside of class. Workload is not bad at all and is mostly reading articles and posting discussion questions. Very interesting material, highly recommend!"
17,3.0,2.0,0,1,"Kate is such a sweet woman and clearly cares about the material. The class is monotonous because each night you do online reading and post a discussion question then talk about it the next day in class. You write one research essay and it is graded almost point by point on an easy to follow rubric. Easy A and interesting, important information!"
18,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Kate is a caring woman and tries to help you engage with the material, although the material itself is somewhat dry. The only homework is doing online readings posted and posting a discussion question. An easy A overall."
19,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Kate is awesome! I have a heart condition, and no matter what, she was always willing to work with me and my illness so that I would have every opportunity to do well in her class. If you want a professor who is gonna actually care about you and the topic they teach, I would definitely recommend her."
20,5.0,2.0,0,0,"Kate is literally such a sweet woman. I really enjoyed this class. She does assign a lot of reading but you don't really have to do all of them because she summarizes them in class. Nonetheless, I would recommend skimming them anyway. It's not a hard class to get an A in and I would recommend taking it."
1,3.5,3.0,1,0,"Dales class is excellent, if you do most of the readings. His class in the past required more assignments but when I took it recently there were only 4 assignments plus a Final Exam - written. He did appear to be condescending in the beginning of the semester but he's trying to provoke good class conversations. Overall, its a good class."
2,3.0,4.0,1,0,"Dale is very smart and eloquent. Unfortunately, to put it mildly, he is not a nice person. He has no qualms about putting you down in front of other students. And he has a very condescending tone. And he is an extremely poor advisor to his grad students. If you're thinking about working with him, proceed with caution. You've been warned. Good luck."
1,1.0,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Woods is sweet, but she speaks SO slow and monotonous. The class environment is not engaging at all."
1,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Youngstrom is an incredibly professor. A lot of students complained about some of the assignments but he does everything for a reason. The assignments are meant to prepare you for graduate level work, but it wasn't too difficult. He's super funny (maybe a little awkward-funny at times) and really cares about his students."
2,5.0,3.0,0,0,"Dr. Y told us this would be taught like a graduate-level class, but definitely not. Very lecture-heavy. However, Dr. Y is a great lecturer! He's an incredibly funny professor (lots of in-class demonstrations of concepts) & is always available to answer questions. Did a great job transitioning to online. Bonus: Two quiz grades replaced by the final."
3,5.0,4.0,0,0,Dr. Y is AMAZING! He is the best professor I have had at UNC. He really cares about his students and you to succeed. It is possible to get an A if you work hard and show you are putting effort into the class.  I would highly recommend taking this class. His lectures are entertaining and he has you apply what you've learned to cases from his clinic.
4,5.0,4.0,0,0,"If you enjoy psychology at all, take any class you can with him! He definitely enjoys the material as well as wants to helps his students succeed. One of the best professors I've had at UNC."
5,4.5,2.0,2,0,Great professor! Highly recommended for any psyc majors. Especially individuals considering graduate school
6,5.0,2.0,1,0,HE IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!
7,4.0,4.0,0,0,"This class was horribly boring.  He tries to make it amusing but I constantly had to fight off sleep.  Nice guy though.  Approachable and always looking to help.  But if you prefer a structured environment, look elsewhere."
8,4.5,1.0,0,0,"Dr. Youngstrom was a great professor. I'm innately horrible at math, and with his help (his TA Andrew Freedman is really good too) I got an A in statistics! Always willing to help, and he obviously designs the class so you can get the highest grade possible. If you have to take PSYC 210, definitely take it with Youngstrom!"
9,4.5,1.0,0,0,"I took this class in summer session. It went fast. The professor tried to make stats interesting, did the best he could with the material. The TA does all the grading and was extremely strict. I disagree with the other student, when the TA made an error grading, he fixed it. The TA was extremely fair."
10,4.5,2.0,0,0,This dude is goofy as hell.  He does his best to makes statistics interesting.  Take his class if you get the chance.  You'll actually learn the material without being bored to tears.
11,4.5,1.0,0,0,"He did a great job of making this a good class.  The class itself is incredibly easy/boring, but he did an awesome job of giving engaging lectures.  He's a really nice guy.  I would definitely recommend him as a professor."
12,4.5,4.0,0,0,"Best Prof Ever! Makes Stats fun and very good at explaining. Recitations are not mandatory, but can be helpful. I totally recommend this class if you have to take psyc 210."
13,4.0,2.0,0,0,"Wonderful guy!!! He made stats painless, which was great since none of us wanted to be there. He also gave us a spreadsheet before the final that told us exactly what each of us needed on the final to get the next highest grade and the next highest etc up to an A, but I think there was a curve at the end too, which explains my solid A."
14,5.0,4.0,0,0,Dr. Youngstrom is one of the greatest professors I have ever had. He managed to make something as boring as statistics extremely fun! I would recommend this class to anyone who is a psychology major or who needs a statistics class!
