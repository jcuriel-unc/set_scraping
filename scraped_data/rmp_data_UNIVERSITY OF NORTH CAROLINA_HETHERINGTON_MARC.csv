1,5.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Professor Hetherington's lectures were always funny, informative, and each class doesn't cover too much content. You're fine as long as you take notes, as he doesn't post lecture notes or powerpoints at all. Tests were a bit harder than expected, but they're curved. Not too difficult a class, but still harder than 100 level classes usually are. "
2,5.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Professor Hetherington is an excellent professor. His lectures are engaging and informative, and made POLI 100 a fun class to go to. He is very funny and his lectures are helpful, take notes. 2 papers, 3 exams are most your grade + recitation, show up, listen, take notes and you'll enjoy this class and get a good grade."
3,3.0,4.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"This class was a LOT harder than expected. The reviews here really fooled me. He's super nice and very funny, but the lectures were boring, he speaks really fast and provides no notes, review sheets, or lecture content. The tests were much harder than they needed to be. "
4,4.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Professor Hetherington is great! He is so funny and entertaining in his lectures. Attendance is not mandatory, and he often does a little recap of the previous class at the beginning of the next class. There are textbooks but he uploads one of them onto Sakai. No slides during lectures but works well. 2 exams + final and 2-3 papers"
5,5.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Prof. Hetherington is super nice and really funny. The lectures were boring but he did everything he could to make them not terrible. The reading is A LOT, but the exams aren't super reading-based. He doesn't take attendance, but you definitely need to go because the lectures aren't recorded and he says a lot of important stuff. "
6,5.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Cannot say enough nice things about Marc! By far the best professor I've had at UNC and I will be checking every semester to take one of his classes again. He's hilarious, engaging, passionate, knowledgeable, and just has such great energy. The course was graded on 3 exams and 2 essays which he prepares you well for. Can't recommend him enough!"
7,5.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,Marc Hetherington is the absolute GOAT. legit the funniest guy I know. Makes lectures super interesting and fun (we had a t-shirt toss one time). Best professor at UNC hands down
8,5.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Just a great teacher, loved the class, entertaining. Gives textbooks but they aren't heavily focused upon."
9,5.0,2.0, POLI208,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Maybe the best professor I've had at UNC. Endlessly kind & caring. Knowledgeable about the material & great at communicating it. We were only graded by 2 exams and a 10 page paper, but there was a lot of flexibility both in terms of what we could write and when we could turn it in. I wish more professors here shared his cheerfulness and compassion."
10,5.0,1.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"All you have to do is take good notes during lecture/recitation and you're good. The information covered in lectures tends to be extremely boring. HOWEVER, Marc is such a naturally funny person that everyone stays engaged. During the course of the whole semester you're only graded by two papers and a few tests. Take this class!!"
11,5.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Professor Heatherington brought a great joy to lectures with jokes and funny stories, you can really tell that he cares about his students. Grading is made up of 2 papers and 3 exams, however the exam questions are released ahead of time. Overall, I would highly recommend."
12,5.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Oh, where to start with professor Hetherington. Marc is truly the most fun and laid back professor I've had at UNC. His lectures are very informal, but if you pay attention you will learn a lot. There were only like 5 assignments for the whole semester, and the grading on them was lenient. Would 100% recommend taking his class."
13,5.0,2.0, POLI208,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"I cannot say enough good things about Hetherington. One of the most genuine and caring profs Ive ever had at UNC. Class was enjoyable and not stressful at all. Talks alot about things that matter in regards to polarization, very interesting and relevant lectures. Take his class you wont regret it!!"
14,5.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Professor Hetherington is so funny and likable! You aren't graded by much, but the TAs grading seem to be fairly easy. Attendance wasn't mandatory, but you should go because he'll drop hints of what tests will be like. I loved his sport jacket collection!"
15,5.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,Easiest class I've taken thus far. There are only a few assignments in the entire class. The only thing you really have to do is attend lectures and take notes. The lectures are always very amusing too!
16,5.0,1.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,I honestly just signed up for this class to fill hours but I am so happy that I did. Prof Hetherington is seriously the best and the most understanding. A funny guy that gives engaging lectures. Highly recommend!!
17,5.0,2.0, POLI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Professor Hetherington is a true GEM in the department! Not only is he a super amazing professor who takes the time to thoroughly explain complicated aspects of government and governmental processes, but he also is such a kind and understanding professor, especially with this class being virtual during this pandemic. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM!"
18,5.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,"Prof. Hetherington is really funny, charismatic, and understanding. I really appreciated how he had us read and discuss both Democratic and Republican materials and how casually he handled class discussion. He's an amazing teacher."
19,5.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,Awesome professor. Lectures were interesting and asynchronous. He connects class material to current events which helps to keep things relevant. Overall there were 2 papers and maybe 3 exams(dont quite remember) but all of which were very easy since he gave exam prompts ahead or time. Easy A if you attend lectures and recitations.
20,5.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARC,HETHERINGTON,Marc is such a likable guy. He did his class asynchronous with a live class option. He also gives out exam questions before the exam which was so helpful. He centered the material around what was going on currently which really helped me understand a crazy year in politics lol.
