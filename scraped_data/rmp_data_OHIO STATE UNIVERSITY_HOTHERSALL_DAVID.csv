1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,In love with his accent.
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4505,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"Dr. Hothersall is amazing! He is incredibly passionate about Psychology and his passion is contagious. His wit and accent keep you engaged during lecture. He is quite a storyteller, and he treats the history of psychology as such. Exams are primarily identification, association, and essay-based, which is refreshing after taking tons of Scantrons."
3,4.0,5.0, PSYCH100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"not an easy A, especially when compared to other psych 100H sections. you do learn a lot though"
4,5.0,4.0, PSYCH100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"Really nice and genuine. Although this is only my first quarter, I cannot see myself getting a better teacher that cares so much about his subject (especially the brain). Not an easy A, but just go lecture, pay close attention, and cram a lot the night before and you'll get an A."
5,5.0,4.0, PSYCH100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,Dr. Hothersall is a great teacher.  He will answer any of your questions and loves to teach. He can hold your attention even early in the morning.  His tests are lecture based so if you go it's a moderately easy A.
6,5.0,2.0, PSYCH809,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"Just had to comment upon the comments: I had David Hothersall for 2 classes in the 1970's, and he was absolutely fabulous then, and by far the best teacher in the department. I'm so gratified to see he has aged like a fine wine."
7,5.0,1.0, PSYCH100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,Best professor I've ever had! Passionate and engaging; The best part is the stories and anecdotes he tells in class.  I'd repeat the class in a heart beat!
8,5.0,1.0, PSYCH100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"This guy is fantastic. He's passionate about what he's teaching and does all he can to help students become passionate as well. So helpful, very understanding, and overall a great guy. Flexible and not a super tough grader. Loved the class, it was worth getting up at 8:30 for."
9,5.0,2.0, PSYCH100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"Really easy and interesting class. One of the easiest honors classes to take, as long as you can keep up with the reading, you should do fine."
10,5.0,1.0, PSYCHH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"Dr. Hothersall was a nice British guy.  His midterms are fairly easy, although it's difficult to get a perfect due to the fill in the blank section.  Fun class, easy to understand, and if you go to lecture, easy A.  Tests are lecture based."
11,5.0,3.0, PSYCHH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"Put it this way: the class ran from 8:30-9:48, and everyone was there pretty much every day.  Dr. Hothersall was incredibly interesting and really helped me retain information about the subject...I was just taking it as a GEC, but now I'm considering a Psych major.  Highly recommended!"
12,5.0,3.0, PSYCHH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"Dr. Hothersall may be the best professor I've had in college. He was extremely clear, very funny, very much willing to help, and very fair. If you keep up with the reading in the book (which is also very helpful) and study, an A is very likely."
13,5.0,1.0, PSYCH505,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"I love his class.  He's funny and very enthusiastic about the subject matter, which makes it much more interesting.  Grade is based entirely on 2 tests, but his grading is flexible.  Also, he has a fun English accent.  Overall, great professor!  Take his class!"
14,4.5,4.0, PSYCHH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"Dr. Hothersall definitely knows how to hold your attention at 8:00 am, he's definitely a teacher worth studying under.  Keep up with readings, pay attention to key details and know your concepts.  With a moderate amount of studying, this class isn't a tough A."
15,3.0,4.0, PSYCHH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"Awesome guy, extremely nice, but I did not like the class.  Discussions are interesting enough, the project is easy, but the exams suck.  They cover an enormous amount of information and it's difficult to know exactly what to study."

17,5.0,3.0, PSYCHH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"Dr. Hothersall made class so fun and the assignments were not difficult at all. Has high standards, but very willing to help and explain. definitely take a class with him!"

19,5.0,3.0, HISTORYOFPSYC,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,"I'm a 100% hetero guy, and this man is adorable.  He is so animated and his accent just makes you pay attention to everything he says, pretty much my favorite class to go to ever."
20,5.0,2.0, PSY809,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,HOTHERSALL,Great professor! He makes history of psychology so interesting with his sense of humor and his text full of stories. Tests are easy. Beautiful British Accent.
