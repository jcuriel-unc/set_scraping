1,5.0,1.0, PUBHEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"Great professor! Online zoom class but he also posts his recordings. Quizzes and tests are very straight forward and if you pay attention on zoom, class is super easy. "
2,5.0,1.0, PUBHEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,HE'S THE GOAT!!!
3,4.0,3.0, PUBEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"his lectures were very repetitive and made little sense, i dont recommend if you need to actually learn the coursework, but he is okay if you just need a GE credit, three midterms and 3/4 quizzes and the final are the only things graded. the class is based off of 100 points and every point is 1% of your final grade, very weird guy overall"
4,4.0,1.0, PUBHEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"Dr. Harris was a kind man, however, it can be difficult to be engaged in his lectures. I almost never attended his class meetings on Zoom and I got a good grade. He only rounds up by half percentages, so I could not convince him to round a 92 to an A."
5,5.0,1.0, PUBEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,Literally never went to class and only watched the review lectures. Super easy class and super smart guy
6,5.0,3.0, PUBHEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"Professor Harris was great! His lectures were very interesting. He only graded based off of tests and quizzes, so you have to do well on those to pass the class. As long as you pay attention in lectures, especially review lectures, you should do well. "
7,5.0,2.0, PUBHEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,Professor Harris is very nice and I found the class decently interesting just very repetitive. The review lectures prep you for quizzes and tests very well. Very organized in the online format and very little work to do. Just 5 quizzes and 2 tests are graded.
8,5.0,3.0, PUBEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"Watch the lectures and you will do fine on the tests. The glass is graded on 2 midterms, 5 quizzes, and a final so you need to do well on those but it's very attainable if you watch the lectures and his review lecture."
9,5.0,1.0, PUBHEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"Just do the assignments and you'll be cool, they're not hard."
10,5.0,3.0, PUBHEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"Harris was great! Very accessible and funny. You don't need a textbook and honestly don't need to go to class unless it's a review day. Tests determine grade, but they aren't impossible. Studying review slides and not going to class will get you an A- or A"
11,5.0,1.0, PUBEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"Dr. Harris is a wonderful man with a lot of experience in epidemiology. He made it very easy to meet with him outside of class and his review sessions went over basically everything on the exam. Going to lectures isn't required or necessary, but it definitely helps with comprehension! It's an easy A if you study."
12,3.0,4.0, PUBEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,This class only included quizzes and tests for the grade which made it a bit difficult but he does care about students and tries to help as much as he can.
13,5.0,5.0, EPI6437,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"Dr Harris MD PHD is the BEST of the BEST! Clinical fellowships are awarded to students who HONOR the GOLDEN RULE, not whining complainers. Do not be short-sighted and point-fixated. Students with lower Grades get nomination for Clinical promotion fellowships. Whining students with higher grades can write themselves recommendation letters."
14,3.0,4.0, PUBHEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"I started with over a 100% after the first exam, and ended with an A- because its only out of 100 points so every single question on the three tests matters heavily. You don't need to go to lecture because the powerpoints are online. There are a few online quizzes that should be automatic 100s."
15,4.0,2.0, PUBEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"Dr. Harris definitely cares about his students success. The quizzes were easy and online. But the tests could be tricky. Just make sure to know the material well and this class should be an easy A. The lectures could be boring, but that happens with any subject."
16,2.0,3.0, PUBEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"Prof. Harris's class is just all about lectures. He's a very chill man, maybe a little too chill. If you have no interest in Epidemiology, you will likely find this class super boring. Review his PowerPoints and you will do fine on your exams. Epidemiology isn't of my interest, so it's not really for me. He's a helpful man though."
17,5.0,3.0, PUBHEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,review power points and you'll be fine. Boring lecture but great professor
18,4.0,1.0, PUBEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"You don't need to attend lectures or read the book. I am an epidemiology minor and even I found his lectures to be boring. Attend the review session and read over the review slides and you'll do well. He is very kind, but boring."
19,3.0,2.0, PUBEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"He has very boring lectures, but some interesting topics. Some lectures are long while others lasted only 20 minutes. If you go to the review sessions he pretty much goes over everything on the exams, which aren't difficult if you study the review slides. There are only two midterms and a final so you have to be very careful."
20,2.0,4.0, PUBEPI2410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,HARRIS,"Extremely boring lectures. He just reads from the slides so attendance isn't mandatory. The slides are very hard to look at. Not sure why, but he chooses to make his slides yellow text on a bright blue background. Sounds like a Michigan fan-probably added to why I didn't like him. There are no homeworks or quizzes, just the midterm and final."
