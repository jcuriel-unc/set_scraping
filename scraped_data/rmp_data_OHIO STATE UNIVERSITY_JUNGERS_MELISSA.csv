1,5.0,1.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,JUNGERS,"She was a great professor; she helped me understand complicated subjects I was struggling with. She also provides guided notes with information-packed knowledge, which eases my understanding. I highly recommend her for any future classes you take with her."
2,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,JUNGERS,"She was so sweet and kind.  Her lectures were posted on Camren to look back on, and everything tested was on the slides.  There were no tricks in her class."
3,2.0,1.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,JUNGERS,"Dr. Jungers is very kind and the class is very easy with little to no weekly homework. If you like challenging classes, you will be disappointed. Her lectures are pretty boring and she does not add anything more that what you learn in the textbook. Her explanations are also very unclear and her in-class activities are kind of pointless."
4,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,JUNGERS,She is so sweet and makes her classes interesting and gives breaks when needed! Dropped the 2 lowest quiz grades and let our tests be open note. She offered 4 different extra credit opportunities throughout the semester and also offers extra credit questions on the tests. She definitely wants to see her students succeed and is clear on due dates.

6,5.0,1.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,JUNGERS,"Great professor Very upbeat, positive, genuine, caring, etc. She gives guided notes, office hours, opportunities to meet tutors, etc She presents the material in a clear and concise way, and you just have to take it in 10/10; Would definitely take one of her classes again."
7,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,JUNGERS,"Dr Jungers is the only reason I didn't drop out this semester. I didn't get to rate my professors on the SEIs because that week was very chaotic, but she deserves a raise. I know you read these, OSU. Get the Kowalskys out, and find more humans like this one. Her classes were fun, informative, and truly made me appreciate M&C. Thank you, Dr Jungers."
8,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,JUNGERS,"Dr. Jungers is a great professor. She tells stories that help you remember information more easily, does kahoots in class, and she gives you guided notes. As always I recommend never missing class if you can help it.

11,5.0,1.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,JUNGERS,She's amazing and very helpful. Class material isn't hard and she makes it very interesting as well. My advice is to read/skim the book and know everything in your notes to be prepared for the quizzes. Do your research credits as soon as possible because it's very easy and do an extra one to boost your grade. Attendance is very important for notes.

I am glad I took her class and would take her again in a heartbeat."

Show up to class, or you might miss something. She does a lot of review and brings lots of props to make sure you get it. Tests are easy as long as you review your notes! She makes class enjoyable!"
14,5.0,2.0, 1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,JUNGERS,"Dr. J is THE BEST professor. She's such a genuine person and you can tell she cares about her students, as well as Psych.
