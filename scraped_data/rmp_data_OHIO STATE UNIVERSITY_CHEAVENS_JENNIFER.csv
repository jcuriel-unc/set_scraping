She is a great professor to get to know: down-to-earth, friendly, and passionate. A fun class that is not too difficult but not too easy either. If you interested,  psych major or not, take this class."

4,5.0,2.0, PSYCH303,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,CHEAVENS,"Dr. Cheavens is one of the best professors I have had at Ohio State. Her lectures are fun, hilarious, and interactive. Her exams are also relatively easy if you prepare before. I would HIGHLY recommend doing the readings, as the essay questions on her exams almost always pertain to them. I would take another class with her again if I could!"

This class was defiantly a class that people wanted to go to, because everything we talked about could be related back to our own lives. Overall a great class, and I would recommend this class even if you are not a psych major, because you learn so much useful information."

9,5.0,3.0, PSYCH530,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,CHEAVENS,She is an amazing teacher. Come prepared to talk about material in class. She doesn't like to just lecture at you so be involved. Read the material and come to class. Hello this is college do the work. She is completely awesome.

11,3.0,4.0, PSY530,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,CHEAVENS,"She could have given me 1 extra point on an essay, but instead decided to stop me from graduating because of ONE POINT. I lost my job teaching at OSU, lost my admissions to graduate school, and was forced to take out an extra loan... over ONE point."
12,4.5,3.0, PSYCH530,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,CHEAVENS,"Dr. Cheavens ""Heavens with a C"" is a really great teacher who seems to really enjoy what she does.  Even when our class doesn't always feel like participating she doesn't lose her energy and spunk!!"
13,4.5,3.0, PSYCH202,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,CHEAVENS,"Dr. Cheavens is smart, presents the material in an interesting and straight forward manner and extremely helpful to her class.  In addition, she is STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL, has a great sense of humor and is apparently a huge sports fan.  Being in her class  was quite possibly the best classroom experience of my college career.  WOW, is all I can say."
