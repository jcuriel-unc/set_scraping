1,4.0,4.0, PS552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"He's very knowledgeable, well known in his field and has a lot of creative, unconventional ideas. Important to keep up with the readings as the midterm (33%) and final (67%) heavily focus on the reading (of which there is a lot). Has an amusing, wry sense of humor which keeps lectures fairly interesting. Definitely worth taking, but tough."
2,4.0,4.0, PS552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"A lot of reading. Tests are extremely specific and difficult (look at previous exams for types of questions) but there's a very significant curve. TAKE THIS CLASS! even though some lectures can be dry, he is incredibly knowledgeable and you will learn so much. great professor"
3,3.0,4.0, PS552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"Prof. Mueller is clearly very knowlegable on the subject and I thought the class was very interesting.  The slides in class are next to useless, and the exams are mostly on what he says in class and the books you are required to read. The books, esp. the one he wrote are easy to read and very informative, my favorite poli sci class yet."
4,3.5,3.0, PS552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,I think he's a little crazy but I really enjoyed having him as a teacher. I learned A LOT in my class and he usually kept my attention. Definitely do the readings (usually one of the books is his.. haha). They came up a lot on the tests. GO TO CLASS. If you go and do the work it's honestly not that hard. It's very straightforward.
5,3.0,1.0, PS552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"Read all of the material, at least come to class and you'll get an A on the exams.  The material is good, but he relies heavily on public opinion polls (in contrast to some of the assigned readings which show how irrelevant they often are) and his lectures often come off as self-aggrandizing."
6,2.5,4.0, POLSC552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,Lectures are difficult to follow since they randomly just jump around subjects.  He posts his slides online so I just printed them and took notes on the print outs.  For the final I read all the readings he assigned in about two days and got a A on it since most of the essay questions were from the readings.
7,5.0,5.0, POLIS552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"This guy really knows his stuff.  He is incredibly knowledgeable in his field.  The problem comes in his tests; they are really hard and incorporate very little from class.  If you do all the readings, then re-read them, and then go to his office hours and talk about them, you will do all right on the tests."
8,4.0,3.0, PS552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"Mueller is a very good lecturer and uses a lot of hard to find video clips in class.  He pushed his own research/bias when we learned about current policies and terrorism.  Nevertheless, class was informative, and there wasn't too much work involved.  That said, keep up with the readings (take notes!) to survive the midterm (33%) and final (67%)."
9,5.0,5.0, POLI552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,I REALLY enjoyed the class and the way he taught.  He was awesome and is extremely intelligent. I would definitely recomend not only taking a class with him but going to office hours to talk to him.  Hes a really nice guy and was extremely helpful when i had questions.
10,2.0,5.0, POL553,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"Tests are ridiculous, he doesnt prepare you for them at all."
11,3.5,3.0, PS525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"Very very intelligent.  Has written several books on this topic.  Knows a ton.  Need to attend class to have much of an idea of what's going on.  Lectures are pretty good, but sometimes can get boring and he likes to go off on tangents occassionally.  Not easy, but not difficult either if you pay attention.  I got a B on the final and didn't read."
12,4.0,5.0, POLISCI552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"This man is EXTREMELY intelligent and knowledgable.  However, the tests are so hard that my 62% turned into a B+ after the curve.  Its rediculous to make the class that hard, but in the end, if you pay attention in class then you'll receive the grade you deserve."
13,5.0,2.0, 552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"This class is NOT difficult.  The tests are a bit hard but the curve is huge and if you pay attention, do the reading, and study you should do fine on them without the curve anyway.  This class is definitely worth your time."
14,3.0,4.0, PS552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,thank god for the curve in the class!!!!!!!!!!!!
15,5.0,3.0, POLISCI552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"I think that I am in the previous reviewer's class.  In fairness to Prof. Mueller, there is a pretty good curve on the midterm.  It makes up for the difficulty on the test."
16,1.0,5.0, PS552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"WTF!!!! Why does he have all these high marks? His midterm was f-ing horrible. everything i didnot prepare for was on it, trust me I prepared.oh yeah, looking at old midterms doesnt accomplish****!"
17,4.0,5.0, PS552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,Smartest teacher I ever had at OSU. Make sure you read and go to class. You'll take a million notes. Highly recommend you take his class.
18,3.5,3.0, PS552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"i loved the class, he is really knowledgeable but the reading is insane. get a study group. his grader was an ****, but i think mueller recognizes who goes to lectures and rewards accordingly. i had bad test grades but never missed a class and talked to"

20,3.5,4.0, POL552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,MUELLER,"LOTS of reading, but alot of it was redundant.. Lots of material, but a very comprehensive course... Know everything for the midterm and final. Curves well..."
