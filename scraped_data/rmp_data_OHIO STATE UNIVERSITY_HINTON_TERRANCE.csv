1,5.0,1.0, 4615,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRANCE,HINTON,"I LOVED this class. He always answered emails, and is a great professor who cares so much about the material. Only a few tests, a final paper, weekly small quizzes, and easy discussion boards. All were extremely easy. Gives a study guide for the tests, just look over the PowerPoint(s) for all assignments and tests, and you will do great. "

7,5.0,2.0, SOC3315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRANCE,HINTON,"I've had Terrance for both Soc 2310 and 3315. His class format is pretty easy to follow: A lecture mixed with an article or two per week, a discussion board and a four question quiz. There is a mid-term and final which are mostly multiple choice with a few short answer, as well as a final 4-6 page paper. It's clear he cares about his students!"
