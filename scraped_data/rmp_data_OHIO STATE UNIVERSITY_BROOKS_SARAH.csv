1,5.0,1.0, POLITSC1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,Take this class immediately if you are looking for easy GE. You do not have to study for a thing and literally can get an A by spending 15 min a week on it (taking the quiz). Its all online.
2,4.0,2.0, POLIS1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,"One of the easiest online classes ive taken. Every week there are two assignments, and as long as you follow the guides she gives you, youll be fine. Easy A"
3,2.0,3.0, POLIS1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,"Took this class as a GE and honestly, worst decision of my life. Professor is absolute, GARBAGE. She said all semester, I will give opportunities to participate in research for extra credit, AND SHE NEVER DID. She also clearly stated in the syllabus, and in emails too, that she would give ONE MINUTE PER QUESTION ON QUIZZES, which NEVER happened."
4,2.0,1.0, POLITSC1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,Before I took this class I looked in the syllabus and saw that there were various extra credit opportunities. I emailed her various times throughout the semester about extra credit and there was only one assignment. Overall I took this class for the extra credit and ended up with one point off the grade I wanted because there was only one asignm..
5,3.0,1.0, POLIS1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,There's  weekly quizzes & assignments which were straight from the power points.  There was also extra credit every week which doesn't take long and I would absolutely recommend.  Make sure to keep all the due dates straight for midterms because you have one window to take it and if you forget you can't retake it.  Never used textbook.
6,2.0,2.0, POLIS1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,"You don't need to read the book.  This is a common sense political science class, plus all the quizzes are on quizlet word for word.  Exams are just same questions from quizzes.  Extra credit is handed out for doing little pointless participation assignments."
7,4.0,2.0, POLITSC1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,"Weekly quizzes and participation, extra credit offered every week, two midterms and a final. Able to search -find answers in the power points so I never really actually listened to lectures. Quizlet is a good help. Get a decent grade on your quizzes, do the participation and extra credit every week and it should be an easy A."
8,3.5,2.0, POLITSC1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,the comment from 4/27/2015 is 100% correct. if you do well on the quizzes and by well i mean above (75%) and do all the participation quizzes you should be able to get an A.
9,4.5,1.0, POLISCI1200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,Dr. Brooks is amazingly accomplished and a great lecturer. She really knows her material; her powerpoints and lectures make the material very clear especially for tests and papers. The class is easy if you go and pay attention. 
10,3.5,3.0, POLISCI1200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,Really really cool person. She's a full bright scholar and has been around the world so she really knows her stuff.
11,4.0,1.0, 1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,online is easy just command find through powerpoints mostly
12,3.5,2.0, POLITSC1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,"Professor Brooks is an absentee-online professor that does research abroad while facilitating the course. You will never see her, or anyone for that matter in the course. Content is straightforward. Readings are unnecessary, just skim through her powerpoints and you will be fine. Take advantage of the extra credit on weekly quizzes; it will add up!"
13,5.0,4.0, 459702,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,Professor Brooks is an excellent teacher and I learned so much from her class. There are 2 midterms and a final paper. The course is somewhat difficult but she is very helpful through email and office hours. She also  offers a lot of extra credit so there is no reason you can't get an A.  Lectures were  more enjoyable because she is hilarious! 
14,1.0,4.0, 1200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,She is one my my least favorite teachers I have probably had. Her attitude is always negative and is not helpful at all. 
15,2.0,3.0, 1200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,"She really is not helpful at all, and is not clear with grades in class since she barely posts them online and you have to keep emailing her in order to see what you have in the class. She grades though and is not understanding. Would not take a course with her again. "
16,5.0,1.0, POLITSC1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,"Dr. Brooks is a really cool online professor. Take this class with her, it is one of the most fun online classes I have ever taken. All her tests are multiple choice and she offers a lot of extra credit.The textbook is also fairly easy to read.  She is highly organized and you learn a great deal  but also get to enjoy the class!"
17,5.0,2.0, POLYSCI1200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,Professor Brooks is extremely intelligent and very knowledgable about her field. If you attend lecture and do the required readings this class is a cakewalk. It doesn't hurt that she's good looking.
18,5.0,2.0, POLITSC1200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,"Professor Brooks is extremely nice and knows what she is talking about. Her class focuses on democracy and she does a great job teaching it. I don't think its necessary to read the textbook if you take god notes but MAKE SURE TO DO THE READINGS. There are a few quizzes, decently hard midterm essay, and a take home final."
19,3.0,4.0, POLISCI1200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,Political science was not as interesting as I thought. Midterm and finally are choosing two of four essay questions. I felt stupid in that class because we moved from one discussion topic to another so fast that I couldn't contribute let alone wrap my head around what we were talking about.
20,5.0,2.0, POLIS1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARAH,BROOKS,"Class was a little dry sometimes, but the overall topics were usually pretty interesting.  An essay midterm and two take-home essays and thats it.  Not too tough.  Pay attention, do the readings, and you'll get an A."
