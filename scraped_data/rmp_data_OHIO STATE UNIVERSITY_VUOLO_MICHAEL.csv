1,5.0,2.0, SOC4560,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VUOLO,"Dr. Vuolo is one of my favorite professors so far. He is very chill and extremely well versed in his material. Attendance isn't mandatory, but it is necessary since the powerpoints aren't descriptive. He gives excellent study guides, with easy exams and papers. He has a lot of information and is a very engaging lecturer, and he also plays videos."
2,5.0,3.0, SOCIO4506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VUOLO,"Dr. Vuolo is great! He is funny and very intelligent without being condescending. I learned a ton from his class. DO go to class, since powerpoints only have bullet points, notes have to be taken in class. Tests are easy, great study guides, pretty much all 4 papers relatively the same. I would definitely take another class with him."
