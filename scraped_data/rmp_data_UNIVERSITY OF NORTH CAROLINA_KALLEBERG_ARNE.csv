1,5.0,2.0, SOCI71,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ARNE,KALLEBERG,"Professor Kalleberg is wonderful! The lectures are entertaining and are also engaging. No tests or quizzes, just short papers weekly/biweekly in which you must recall the required readings (which were short). No final exam. "
2,5.0,2.0, SOCI71,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ARNE,KALLEBERG,"Class was interesting and engaging, and super easy. If you're not doing well you're not trying. He mostly stands out for how he is as a person! He really cares about his students and makes an effort to know everyone. He's not the most tech savvy, so we spent a lot of classes with him on the phone with its, but we laughed it off! HIGHLY recommend"

Also, the class wasn't difficult - as long as you're a decent writer and you do all the assignments, his class will be fun and fairly easy!"
