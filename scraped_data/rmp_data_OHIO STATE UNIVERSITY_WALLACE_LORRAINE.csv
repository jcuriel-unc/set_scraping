1,3.0,1.0, MEDCOLL3998,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LORRAINE,WALLACE,Dr. Wallace was a fine professor but she took on more than she could chew with this course. She had to be in charge of 7 different academic papers. Every week we would go over the same things because she couldn't remember what we discussed previously. We would only meet for about ten minutes each week.

It ended up being very enjoyable, classes weren't every single week, assignments were doable, and the professor cares and is super friendly. Opened my eyes to different kinds of research& you can get to watch Mythbusters! 10/10 would recommend!"
