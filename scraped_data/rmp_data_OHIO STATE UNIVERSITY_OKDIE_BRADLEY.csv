1,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,"Dr. Okdie is super funny and very nice. He cares for his students! Quizzes each week (not many questions so don't feel nervous) and it's based on his lectures mainly so really focus on that! Easy class fr and interesting, I def recommend it!!"
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,Dr. Okdie is wonderful! Very helpful with questions and very knowledgeable. Very kind and caring for students. Lectures were interactive and fun. Only 1 chapter and 3 hours of lecture a week. Discussions were very fun. Highly recommend taking Dr. Okdie's class. Quizzes ask stuff from his lectures while Exams focus primarily on book content.
3,4.0,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,"only an easy a if youre genuinely interested/ ready to work and learn. otherwise, you will fall behind and fail. i did not go to class besides for exams ( maybe a few lectures) and maintained an A all semester. he has tons of extra credit too!"
4,5.0,4.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,Dr. Okdie is a model Professor.
5,3.0,4.0, PSYCH1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,"Dr. Okdie is a very funny, caring man but the thing that is hard with him is that he talks very fast. His slides are always way too long for him to finish them in one class period, so you're stuck rushing and not getting all of the information he is telling you. Also you will need to read the textbook, he puts random questions on the test."
6,5.0,4.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,"Amazing, he rounded my grade up from a D+ to a C-. Although attendance is not required, I would recommend going because a lot of what is on the exams are only talked about in lectures and are not always on the slides provided on Carmen."
7,5.0,4.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,Dr. Okdie cares a lot about his students. After every exam he gives you feedback and lets you know he notices the progress you have made! One of the best professors I've had
8,5.0,4.0, PSY11000,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,"Great professor that cares about his student and the material that he teaches. Make sure you come to class, pay attention, and be engaged and that will get you majority of the way and DO NOT neglect reading each of the chapters or else you'll regret it. Only downside is that he doesn't nessciarily give study guides for his exams."
9,5.0,4.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,"Such an amazing professor! Class is okay just as long as you read the textbook, study, and pay attention to the lectures. You can tell he loves what he does and wants all his students to succeed. Btw he is absolutely hilarious. Definetly recommend taking his class! "
10,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,"Make sure you read and take notes on each chapter before class, and pay attention to lectures. If you do that you'll do fine on exams. Finish the research credits early! He does in-class assignments but they are easy, and there's one essay but it's super easy to get 100% on. If you go to class you'll pass, if you study you'll get an A+."
11,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,He's such a good professor. Take his class!!
12,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,"Dr. Okdie is a great professor, his lectures are always amazing and very interesting. You only have three tests and a final exam and then assignments in class. He will ask questions on the tests that you did't cover in class sometimes so read your book, but it is a good class!"
13,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,Dr. Okdie is an amazing professor and i strongly recommend taking him! He makes class really interesting and is very funny! take him!
14,5.0,2.0, PSYCH 1110.01,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,Dr. Okdie is by far one of the most amazing professors i've had. He understands and as a Psych major he makes the material interesting and is consistently making students get up and get involved in class to keep us awake. I'd totally take his class again. It's amazing. 
15,4.5,4.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRADLEY,OKDIE,Dr. Okdie is very intelligent and such a sweet person. I loved going to his class simply because he was funny and was great at what he does. The material to me was very hard... he speaks quickly and seems to forget we don't have a graduate degree and are as talented as himself. But he will go above and beyond for his students if needed.
