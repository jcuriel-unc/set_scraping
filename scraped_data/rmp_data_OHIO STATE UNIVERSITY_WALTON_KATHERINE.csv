1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4571,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHERINE,WALTON,Dr. Walton is amazing. She is dedicated and very knowledgable about the class subject. She was also really understanding when this class was taught during the pandemic. She grades pretty easily too as long as you do the work. The class is super interesting.
