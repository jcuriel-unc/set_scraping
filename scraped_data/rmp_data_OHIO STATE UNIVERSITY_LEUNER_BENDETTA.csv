1,3.0,3.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,"4644 is a good class for the sequenced advanced psych class, but I had to study a lot to get good grades. the lectures are pretty boring and when you ask questions in class she usually doesn't even know the answer. there are extra credit opportunities and the homework is easy, but the exams can be tough. overall, its a fair class."
2,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,"Dr. Leuner is wonderful! Her lectures were exceptionally well-organized with clear information and lots of real-world examples. I appreciated how she worked in relevant cultural topics and integrated science + society together.  Outside of class, she prioritizes communication and is accessible to answer questions and provide guidance."
3,5.0,1.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,"Dr. Leuner is a great professor, and I really loved the class! I loved how she worked some important social issues into her presentations. The class is super interesting, which always makes studying easier! Her quizzes and final were very fair."
4,4.0,3.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,You don't need to show up to this class to do well. All lectures are posted online and her exams come directly off that. Sometimes there are experiments that are on the slides that may be unclear if you don't show up to class. I only showed up to class on exam days and started studying 3-4 days before. She also drops lowest exam and provides EC
5,5.0,1.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,Might be the easiest upper-level neuro class OSU offers. Dr. Leuner is great and the material you learn is very useful for the MCAT. Never went to class and studied for exams the night before and got an easy A. She offers extra credit for every exam. Highly recommend using Anki to keep up with the material. VERY EASY A!! TAKE this class.
6,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,"I LOVE Dr. Leuner. She's very relaxed about teaching and just wants her students to understand more about hormones and the brain. There are 4 multiple choice exams and 10 points of extra credit given throughout the course. One exam is dropped from your grade, but you have to take the final. She can be so funny during lecture too in very subtle ways"
7,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,"Dr. Leuner is a great professor and she is always willing to help her students with their problems. Her lecture is very comprehensive and her exam is fairly easy, of course as long as you study for it."
8,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,Dr. Leuner is great. This was by far one of my favorite Neuro courses. Would leave class everyday fascinated. Drops lowest Midterm grade but ended up allowing us to drop our cumulative final because the averages were low. Super fair and great!
9,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,Dr. Leuner is one of the best professors I've ever had! She is passionate about what she teaches and cares that students do well.
10,2.0,4.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,"So, 4 tests, hard, and thats it for grades. Some extra credit, but not enough to actually help. She only reads off the slides, so going to class is a waste of time. Must read the book and extra articles for tests. Her tests are also very wordy and you slip up on them if you don't take your time. Not one to boost your GPA--difficult :("
11,5.0,1.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,"Extremely bright professor, very knowledgable, and always willing to go above and beyond to help students understand the material. Would take another class with Dr. Leuner in a heartbeat."
12,4.5,2.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,"Dr. Leuner is very clear in her lec. which are based on slides. Textb. difficult to get through; highly technical and dry. Exams mainly based off of lec. & slides. 4644 Hormones and Behavior has a lot of info. Dr. Leuner seems to keep it on the simpler side, so if you are a neuroscience extraordinaire, it may not be detailed enough for your taste."
13,3.0,2.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,Class isn't difficult if you attend and study the notes. Enjoyed the subject matter and thought it was interesting. Dr. Leuner is a good lecturer and her exams are very fair.
14,4.0,3.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENDETTA,LEUNER,"Dr. Leuner is a really great teacher! I feel like I learn a lot from her, and she is challenging in a good way. I took Behavioral Neuro with her and am now taking Hormones and Behavior and I love both classes."
