1,5.0,3.0, PSY210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Dr. Harrison is the best professor I've ever had the pleasure of taking a class with. He genuinely wants his students to succeed and he gives great lectures. Everything was open note so if you take good notes in class, the tests are not too difficult. He always responds to emails, even at midnight."
2,5.0,4.0, PSY210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Midterm and final were kind of hard. Try to get old midterms from a friend to practice. Otherwise, moderate work load. Not the easiest class by any means, but take Harrison. Good guy."
3,5.0,2.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Patrick Harrison is the most caring, kind, and warmhearted professor I have had a chance to encounter at UNC.  He is also an amazing lecturer :) "
4,5.0,2.0, PSYC270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Dr. Harrison is an amazing professor who made the course paper manageable! He actually cares about students' mental health and well-being. Plenty of extra credit opportunities were provided, and deadlines were extended for students to make his class more convenient. Lectures were funny and inspiring, which was needed for the late afternoon. "
5,5.0,2.0, PSYC270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Dr. Harrison is the nicest and most caring professor I've ever met. He is accessible outside of class. The class is based on one research paper (~20-30pgs); The paper has separate deadlines throughout the year, so it's bearable. Come to class! Participation is the only factor that could've made my A- to an A. I had a B+, and he rounded me to an A-!"
6,5.0,1.0, PSY270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,A very caring teacher than knowledges the stresses of college students so he is super considerate
7,5.0,2.0, PSY270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Amazing professor and overall person! Super kind, funny, and passionate about what he teaches. We need more like him at UNC. Very responsive to emails and flexible. "
8,5.0,3.0, PSYC270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Truly one of a kind. UNC has a gem by having him teach here. He is so caring and truly respects and worried about all his students. He is funny and understand that you are not only a student, but a person as well. 10/10 recommend! Favorite professor at UNC!"
9,5.0,1.0, PSY270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,This is hands down the best professor at UNC. He truly cares about his students and allows flexibility with deadlines in an effort to allow his students to actually learn things. He will help you in any way he can! Take as many of his classes as you can.
10,4.0,2.0, PSY210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Nicest professor I have ever seen. Tries to present statistics in a very digestible way. However, class can be extremely slow. Additionally concepts are presented in such a general way that it causes it to mush with all of the other concepts we learned previously. This leads to things being more confusing than it needs to be. But overall easy class"
11,5.0,2.0, PSY210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"I could not recommend Dr. Harrison enough. If I could take any class with him again, I would 100% would. He is so kind and he really cares about his students and their well-being.  Dr. Harrison is genuinely such a caring person and he keeps lectures interesting.  You can make memes for extra credit in his class.  Take him if you can!!"
12,3.0,2.0, PSY210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Harrison is an awesome person, but I just want to warn that, at least in his Psych 210 class, you will succeed mostly if you are an auditory learner. Slides don't really contain any information that is helpful when it's exam time. He tries to assist outside of class, but if you can't process lots of information auditory, get ready for a battle. "
13,5.0,2.0, PSY210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"one of the best professors at UNC! I had him for both psyc210 and psyc270 and still use what he taught me. I highly recommend a class with Patrick, it's an easy A as long as you participate"
14,5.0,3.0, PSYC270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"I took Harrison for PSYC210 last fall and my choice to take him again for PSYC270 this fall was one of the best choices I have made at UNC. Dr. Harrison is kind, caring, and one of the best professors I've ever had at UNC. The material in this class is difficult but with Dr. Harrison it's manageable"
15,5.0,2.0, PSY210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Professor Harrison is one of my favorites at UNC. He tries to make the class as easy to understand as possible. The assignments are relatively easy, but the midterm and final were challenging. He is super easy to work with and flexible with deadlines to meet student feedback. "
16,5.0,1.0, PSY270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,Dr. Harrison is the best! I was lucky enough to have him for both 210 and 270 and he is amazing. Truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed both inside and outside the class.
17,5.0,1.0, PSYC270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,best professor I've had at UNC. genuinely cares about his students and their success.
18,5.0,1.0, PSY210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Dr. Harrison is great, and any pre-health should take this class if they need statistics. He is caring and doesn't pull dumb stunts or make things too difficult. He is one of the few professors who cares for the mental well-being of his students. The main components of the course are assignments, quizzes, participation, and the midterm and final. "
19,5.0,4.0, PSY270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,I took 210 and 270 with Dr. Harrison. He is the kindest professor I have ever had. The class itself is research-heavy. You will have to conduct and write a research paper (25-30 pages). But Dr. Harrison made it durable. He always writes kind words to us and tells us how much he appreciates our efforts and energy. Dr. Harrison is the best. 
20,5.0,1.0, PSY210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PATRICK,HARRISON,"Having Dr. Harrison as a professor was a breath of fresh air. If you can take one of his classes as a UNC student, DO IT!!! I can't recommend him enough. He is accommodating, cares about the well-being of his students, and wants his students to succeed!!! The material is easily digestible when learning through him. "
