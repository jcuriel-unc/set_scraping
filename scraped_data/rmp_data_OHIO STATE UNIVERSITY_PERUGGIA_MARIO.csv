1,5.0,5.0, STAT4301,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIO,PERUGGIA,"Dr. Peruggia was a great instructor this past semester for Stat 4301! The course content is rather difficult for an undergrad course since it is statistical theory, but he is able to cohesively explain the concepts well. I liked the system of quizzes as they provided good practice for the exams. Difficult exams but the course was curved in the end."
2,1.0,5.0, STAT4301,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIO,PERUGGIA,"The lecture note is not useful and hard to recognize what he writes. He doesn't give any sample practices before the exam review. only gives the range of sections. The tests were hard, the exam questions were related, and if you didn't figure out the first one, the rest of the questions could not solve."
3,2.0,5.0, STAT4301,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIO,PERUGGIA,"The slides are disorganized and hard to read his handwriting. I took the first in person class after Covid and he probably had too high expectation on students. The exams are heavy with two midterms and one final, each with hard prove with few numbers and given little partial credits. He has few examples on slides. Consider not taking his class."
4,1.5,5.0, STAT6801,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIO,PERUGGIA,"Yes, he has an accent and sometimes it was hard to make out what he was saying, but it seemed to me that the real problem is that Professor Peruggia failed to show that he was very interested in teaching.His priority was going through the required material on time but not necessarily explaining it."
5,1.0,5.0, STAT645,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIO,PERUGGIA,His class is really disorganized. his italian accent could drive people crazy.
6,5.0,2.0, STAT427,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIO,PERUGGIA,"Mario is a great teacher. He explains things in good detail, and is relatively funny, too. His practice midterms are a pretty close to his actual midterms."
7,4.5,2.0, STAT427,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIO,PERUGGIA,"Fun teacher and very clear, though he has a thick Spanish accent.  He likes cats a lot.  Easy to follow along in class, almost the same thing every day.  If you follow along with notes, you will be fine."
8,5.0,5.0, STAT622,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIO,PERUGGIA,"Peruggia is a fantastic instructor.  He really knows his stuff, and gives a great lecture.  Do not expect to be spoon-fed.  He expects you to work as hard as he does."
