She structures her class in a great way for a busy college student: four exams are your only grades, so you don't have outside mandatory homework or quizzes to do. It is really up to you to learn the material-and she wants to help you. Midterms aren't mandatory and can only help your grade. TAKE this class with her!"
2,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELIZABETH,KIRBY,"I loved this class. I did it online, she talked so fast I needed to watch recordings, but regardless of long lectures, they were interesting! Great job of preparing you for exams, which is the only thing the class is graded on. She only counts your final exam grade, but if any of your 3 midterm grades would improve that score, she also counts them."
