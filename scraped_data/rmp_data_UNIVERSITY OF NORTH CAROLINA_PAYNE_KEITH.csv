1,5.0,1.0, PSYC565,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEITH,PAYNE,"This class was super easy, definitely would recommend. The material wasn't hard and he explains it very well. There are discussion questions due every week, but they are easy. There are 3 exams and a final, and they were all easy as long as you paid attention in class. Plus you get to use notecards on the exams."
2,1.0,2.0, PSYC190,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEITH,PAYNE,"Dr. P is another hypocritical hater of white Americans.  He believes white Americans are too blame for all the misfortunes of minorities.  Dr. Payne, if really believe this, you need to give up your position as professor for a minority who did not have the same opportunities as you.  If you want to be propagandized  by a Communist take this class. "
