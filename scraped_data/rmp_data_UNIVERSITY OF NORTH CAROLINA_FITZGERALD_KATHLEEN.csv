1,2.0,4.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"Very strange grading scale that left little to no room for mistakes. Participation/attendance wasn't graded, but the lectures are basically mandatory if you want to do well. Grades papers extremely harshly and is not very considerate of student circumstances. Also, a lot of reading if you want to do well."
2,1.0,5.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,Read the prior comments. They are the truth! Would not recommend her class! 
3,1.0,4.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,Insanely condescending and would criticize students who chose to participate. She grades super harshly on her assignments and has a weird grading scale. She is clearly well-educated in her field and wants to spread a positive message but would say slurs during some of her lectures. Way too hard for a level 100 class.
4,1.0,4.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"Professor Fitzgerald ruined my second semester. Her lectures are insightful, but I hated everything else in her class. For a 100 level course, it is absolutely not worth it. DO NOT TAKE SOCI 122. Exams WILL be worth at least 70% of your final grade, and she does not curve. If you want your GPA ruined, I would highly recommend. "
5,1.0,4.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"She is genuinely the rudest professor that I have had throughout my academic career. She is snarky, non-accommodating, and disrespectful to her students. She is a very hard grader on the written material, and it's not worth getting help from the TAs. The only good thing is that she is knowledgeable, but it seems that she likes to see students fail"
6,1.0,4.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,Kathleen isn't that bad when it comes to the content of her course it's just her attitude as a teacher that is unnecessary and disrespectful. Don't even think about emailing her about anything related to the course. She would rather send a snarky comment through email than answer your question. Doesn't allow for discussion that differs from hers. 
7,4.0,3.0, SOCI273,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"Professor Fitzgerald is extremely knowledgeable, and I truly enjoyed taking her class. Students were required to complete a 30 hour learning placement, which is a hefty time commitment, but I thought this facet of the course was imperative to true application of the topic. Professor Fitzgerald was a bit foreboding at times, but also quite funny."
8,4.0,4.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"Dr. Fitzgerald is an okay professor. She is very knowledgeable but can be passive-aggressive during lectures. Her lectures are boring but interesting at the same time. Her exams are a bit tough but she gives you a study guide, USE IT The study guide is very helpful. READ THE CHAPTERS. The chapters are very important. If you don't read you will fail"
9,5.0,3.0, SOCI122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"I was nervous reading reviews but Fitzgerald is really sweet and truly cares about her students' wellbeing! Attendance is not taken but if you miss lecture, read the textbook. The study guides she provides are EXTREMELY helpful, use them! 3 exams (30ish MC and 1-2 SA), 2-3 extracurric. activities, fair amt of reading. You can get away w/ skimming. "
10,5.0,4.0, SOCI125,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"122 & 125- She's incredibly knowledgeable about the material. I Never talked in 122, & only a few times in 125, but I showed up to every class and got 100 for participation in both. She gives study guides for midterm/final that you just have to fill in straight from the textbook/notes. 
"
11,3.0,4.0, SOCI125,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,I think she gets a bad rap for sometimes good reason but I think she had good intentions and does care. Besides that as long as you put in effort it's relatively easy to achieve a good grade in this class. Midterm and Final are pretty much whatever she lectured on and multiple choice which helps a lot.  
12,4.0,3.0, SOCI122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"Dr. Fitzgerald is not a bad professor at all. She tries her best and is very knowledgeable about the topic being taught in class. If you think of not going to class, think again. Her lectures are interesting but are quick paced and you have to be able to keep up. Note-taking and reading are crucial and very important if you want to pass the class. "
13,5.0,5.0, SOCI273,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,I took her for both Soci 273 and 122 last semester.  I worked pretty hard but ended up getting A's in each.  I really enjoyed the classes and learned a lot.  I found out my dad has terminal cancer a few weeks before finals season and she was really accommodating and kind.  She grades papers pretty easy but tests can be hard.
14,5.0,3.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"Overall, Professor Fitzgerald was a pretty good professor. The class isn't too difficult, but it's not an easy A if you don't do the work. While the slides she shows during class and the textbook can be helpful for the exams, it's important to listen to what she actually says during lectures as it can give more detail and fix any confusion. "
15,5.0,4.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"Dr. Fitzgerald is really great! Her class was definitely not easy and you had to read the textbook chapter before every class to understand what was going on. There were a few quizzes that were 5 points each, a book review (I didn't read it and got an A), two discussion posts, a midterm and a final. Really important class and learned a lot!"
16,1.0,5.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"Dr. Fitzgerald is incredibly rude and discouraging over email and in lectures. She is condescending toward students that choose to participate. She is incredibly inaccessible outside of class, and she and the TAs do not give good feedback on the few assignments that you turn in. Save yourself the trouble, and do not take this class."
17,1.0,4.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"Dr. Fitzgerald has some interesting lectures set up, however the class itself is ruined by her attitude towards other students. I often felt discouraged from participating in lecture due to her remarks towards students who spoke. "
18,3.0,3.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"SOCI122 is definitely a harder 100 level SOCI class, but the content is important and I think presented well. I do not think Professor Fitzgerald would get the same type of ratings she does if she was a male professor, to quote another review here. If you are interested in the content and want to learn more, do not be afraid to try the class! "
19,1.0,4.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"Lectures move slow, but are informative. Attendance is mandatory and the professor can be condescending at times."
20,5.0,3.0, SOC122,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,FITZGERALD,"Did not find Dr. Fitzgerald to be rude or uncompromising, but she is blunt, outspoken, and passionate. If you keep up with textbook readings, then lectures may be repetitive/boring as they are summaries of chapters. Study guides provided for tests are tickets to an A. Very little homework, interesting content."
