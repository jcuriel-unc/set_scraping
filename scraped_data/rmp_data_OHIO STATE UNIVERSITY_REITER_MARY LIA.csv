2,5.0,4.0, SOC4509,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARY LIA,REITER,"Mary is the best professor I've had. She is incredibly kind and understanding, so it's okay to miss class- but the material is SUPER important to get. Plan on going every lecture. The readings and topics can be difficult, but she is a phenomenal and engaging lecturer. Always well-prepared. Fascinating class! Fair grading. "
3,1.0,5.0, SOCIO4509,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARY LIA,REITER,just dont take it if you have other hard classes. she deducts points on not having comma on the essay.
4,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL4509,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARY LIA,REITER,One of the most genuine professors I've had at OSU. She really showed that she cared about us and adjusted the syllabus and assignments to make it as easy as possible for us during the pandemic. The assignments and exams are very easy as long as you do the readings and listen to the lectures (she goes over the reading's main points in lecture).
5,5.0,3.0, SOC4509,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARY LIA,REITER,Dr. Reiter's class is so interesting. She is extremely knowledgeable about the topic and amazing at her job. She is funny and so helpful. Highly recommend.
6,1.0,4.0, SOCIOL3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARY LIA,REITER,"As an online class Professor Reiter was terrible. She just assigned reading in the book, made us take a quiz after every chapter (15) and had 3 exams. She does not give extra credit and did not record lectures."
7,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARY LIA,REITER,"She is so fun and you can tell she genuinely cares about her class and students. She has tons of experience and stories and is very easygoing. She posts the learning objectives which follow the textbook, so studying for exams is very easy and she definitely isn't trying to trick you in the exams. Highly recommend taking her."
8,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARY LIA,REITER,"Mary is one of the funniest and most engaging professors Ive had thus far. The class is very lecture-oriented and requires you to read the textbook in order to do well on the exams, but if you study then you should be fine! Shes very passionate and knowledgeable, and its an extremely interesting class to take assuming youre interested in law!"
9,4.0,2.0, SOC3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARY LIA,REITER,"A sweet,Lovely woman, shes really a gem and wants all her students to succeed. Show up to class, all the tests are based on the readings and lecture notes. If you want an A,SHOW UP to class. The material is hard to follow but if you ask for her help she will make sure you have a clear understanding of the material. The tests r all multiple choice"
