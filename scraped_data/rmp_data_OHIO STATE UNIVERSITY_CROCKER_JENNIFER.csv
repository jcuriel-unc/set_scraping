1,2.5,2.0, PSY4475,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,CROCKER,"The material itself is interesting, but she reiterates a lot of what she says, making classes boring and redundant. Easy to get a good grade, but a chore to enjoy. She can also be condescending when answering student questions."
2,5.0,1.0, PSYCH4475,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,CROCKER,"This class focuses a lot on applying what you learn on yourself, which is a lot different from the usual psych class. The work is very simple and easy although it does require you to attend to class (to get the notes and do the exercises) and do a lot reflecting on your behalf (since it is about you and your personal situations)."
3,5.0,2.0, PSYCH475,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,CROCKER,Extremely invested in students' success.  Could not possibly be nicer or more approachable.
4,2.0,2.0, PSYCH475,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,CROCKER,"Incredibly boring instructor. Feels like a self help section more than a university level class. It's not difficult so long as you keep up with class material, but doing so feels like a chore. No textbook, readings online (and all more interesting than the lectures), but you do have to pay $10 for a folder full of useless charts. Do not take!"
