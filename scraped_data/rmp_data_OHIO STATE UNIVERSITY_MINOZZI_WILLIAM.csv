1,5.0,3.0, POLS4165,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"Minozzi in my opinion is one of the most underrated professors I have ever had. He was a great lecturer, beginning of course is kind of theory heavy, however, the class was interesting and he always explained things clearly and in a snarky funny way. Would definitely recommend taking his class. Not especially difficult either!!"
2,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"Minozzi was definitely the best professor I have ever had. He's very quirky and helps you understand the material in a funny way. As long as he sees you're putting forth an effort, you will pass his class. There are a lot of readings so make sure you do them or you will definitely struggle."
3,4.0,5.0, POLSC509,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"The fans understand his stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate him, to realise that he says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike William truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldnt appreciate, for instance, the humour in William existential catchphrase ""it's a feature not a bug."""
4,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"Really engaging, and in a class that's centered around the President, he makes a concious effort to stay as nonpartisan and unbiased as possible. He is extremely engaging, and present his leftures in a way that makes you think. My favorote class I've taken so far, and one of the most fair classes I've taken. 10/10 would reccomend this professor."
5,4.0,2.0, PS4110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"He's really involved and is always willing to help outside of class, he never gives you the answer but gives you the info and tools to figure it out for yourself. Really great guy!"
6,4.0,4.0, PS4110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"I think this professor gets a bad rep. He is a very tough grader and I struggled on the first exam but was able to recover.  If you seek out the help, he's there for you when you do. AMAZING lecutres, corky and funny. Really engages the students. I lowkey love going to this class. Attendance notmandatory but I highly recommend going. no textbook"
7,3.0,4.0, 4165,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"like most PA classes, he assigns research papers for each class. He does however have quizzes each class over readings. I personally don't recommend taking this class if you want to gain something w/your PS degree. 4 essay exams, tough grader. He does allow you to use a cheat sheet(1 page).  Go to class, otherwise you will not do well on the exams."
8,3.0,3.0, 4891H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"Nice enough guy, kinda smarmy. 70% of grade was 15 page minimum paper."
9,5.0,2.0, POLS4165,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,Prof Minozzi is an interesting teacher. I learn new things through our class discussions and research papers we read. Fair expectations and smart guy. We have four non-cumulative exams and one easy quiz every class just to make sure you read the research papers. He's friendly and approachable in his office hour. Has a nice room too. Commendable.
10,3.5,2.0, PSCI509,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,Prof. Minozzi was very knowledgeable and interesting to listen to. He wasn't at all flexible in dealing with (excused) absences though. Overall a good professor to take a class from.
11,2.0,4.0, POLSC501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"Smart guy, but very unwilling to help in my opinion. If you attend class and do the readings, you should be alright. But don't expect very helpful responses if you email/ask him questions."
12,5.0,5.0, PS501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"He is really intelligent and makes class interesting.  There was a data project about one of several topics relating to the presidency: mine was about the relationship between the state of the economy and the probability for an incumbent to be re-elected.  It is a really fun project, and you should get an A if you take it seriously."
13,4.5,2.0, PS509,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"Smart guy, Stanford degree. Knows his stuff, will do all he can to make sure you know it too. Kinda smug, but deservedly so: he's bright. Word of warning: there are daily assignments, and his TA is a bit of a wack job with a stingy rubric. If you do it, you get at least a C, but for those who'd rather get an A on every assignment, it's frustrating."
14,4.5,4.0, POLSC509,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"Not the easiest class, but he does a great job of communicating the subject matter clearly.  A clear sense of impartiality, which is necessary in discussions of presidential politics.  Maybe the best teacher I've had."
15,4.5,3.0, POLSC501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"Prof. Minozzi was extremely insightful and helpful.  While the class can be contain lots of reading, he went beyond what most professors would in order to explain it.  His exam was fair.  And he's a heck of a nice guy."
16,4.0,4.0, POLI501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"This was a great class. Easy grade if you did the reading, came to class, and followed instructions. And if you do those things you actually learn a lot! What more could you ask for. Some say he picks on students, but its just sarcastic humor and he is actually pretty funny."
17,3.0,3.0, POL501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"Minozzi is an OK guy and I think he cares about his students. However, he grades oddly and bases class grade on two things. Apparently he and a group of grad. students graded the midterm and as a result, grades were all over the place. Final included a lot of ""gotcha"" questions that had no relevance to the big picture. Doubt he gives out many As."
18,5.0,3.0, PS501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,"This isn't high school.  For a 500 level class Minozzi's expectations were reasonable.  Participation points are a giveaway.  It's a reward for reading.  When I needed help, I went to office hours.  He went to Stanford and knows his stuff.  If you are intellectually challenged- this isn't your class."
19,1.0,5.0, PS501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,He is the worst professor I have ever had. He speaks down to anyone and does not clarify information at all. If you are considering taking a class with him DON'T.
20,1.0,5.0, PS501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MINOZZI,This prof. should be fired for his ignorance.  He treats students like dirt.  His finaly grade was a ripoff.  He missed at least 3 classes due to illness and punished me severely for missing class also even though I had an excuse.  He is jerk.  And I hope he gets fired and never teaches again!
