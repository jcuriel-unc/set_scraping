1,2.0,4.0, PSC4305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,Lecture heavy. He makes some really interesting arguments. That's about all I can say.
2,5.0,2.0, POLITSC4305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,Only negative thing you could say about Wendt is that his class seems to attract students who can't help but think their contributions to class discussion are God's gift to man. Favorite professor I've had at OSU and easy A if you attend class and put in a decent amount of effort.
3,5.0,3.0, POLISCI4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"I love his lecture style, he writes an outline on the board and then tells all of the details. Very intelligent, and I really respect his work. I looked forward to attending this class. The reading quizzes can be quite detailed and are weighted heavily so definitely read! I got As on all of the exams, and an A in the class. Final grade is curved"
4,5.0,3.0, POLISCI4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"Professor Wendt is the best in the field for a reason. His lectures are incredible and he really makes you think through the material. Easily approachable and very friendly, definitely not a stuffy suit political scientist. One of the nicest people I have had the pleasure of being taught by. Alex is brilliant and his work is amazing."
5,5.0,4.0, POLISCI4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,The best teacher I have ever had. He really engages in lecture and encourages class participation. Make sure you find a friend in class in case you miss because exams are based off lecture and (sort of) readings. Going to class is essential to your grade as well as taking good notes. He is approachable so don't be afraid to go to office hours.
6,4.0,4.0, POLISCI4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"This course was definitely a challenge for me since day one, but I really enjoyed the professor. He is respected and very highly educated. He makes the complex course material interesting by putting enthusiasm into it. If you work hard and like a challenge you will do great."
7,4.0,4.0, POLISCI4305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"This course does not offer extra credit and is based on a small number of grades. 3 quizzes and 3 exams. Reading is highly encouraged, but I've gotten by without reading a single paper and I have an A. He is a tough grader. All exams are completely right out, no multiple choice. Be prepared to study."
8,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"Grade 3 test, each worth 1/3 of the Grade. Gets harder each test, and the last essay question you literally have nowhere to copy from but to think hard for yourself. Enjoyed it so much. Didnt do many the reading, but make sure to attend and take notes."
9,5.0,4.0, POLISCI4305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"3 exams worth 1/3 of grade. Exams consist of four short answer questions and one essay. Wendt is organized, provocative, approachable, helpful, funny, humble, the most influential IR scholar of the last 20 years, provocative, organized, funny. Took 22 poli sci classes at OSU and this was the best. Students lined up to shake his hand after the final"
10,4.0,4.0, POLITSC4305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"Dr. Wendt is a renowned professor, and it sure shows. The concepts he works with are very pressing to the field of IR, and he presents them in very concise ways (though he can be a little dry). Naturally this material is still complex so the class is not easy, but if you show up, take good notes, and study with some classmates, you'll be fine."
11,5.0,4.0, POLISCI4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"This class was by far the greatest class I've ever taken in my 4yrs of undergrad. Dr. Wendt IS constructivism. Don't skip class, he only teaches one course and every lecture is incredibly interesting, insightful, organized and beneficial. Soak up all you can from this guy, he is literally the most interesting and intelligent human on the planet!"
12,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"Dr. Wendt is one of the most well-respected political scientists of our generation. Firstly, he is the father of the constructivists school of thought in international relations. Second, he is so well-versed it will astound you. He is very helpful and welcomes visitors to his office hours. Google him and bow down to his greatness. Take his class."
13,5.0,2.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,One of the best professors at OSU
14,4.0,3.0, POLS4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"Interesting course. Lectures can be a bit boring but if you zone out/miss class you will miss ALOT. Tells you what will be on exam so you can prepare. Weird grading system where he adds up all points throughout the semester (only 3 exams worth 1/3 of grade) then gives out grades. No book, readings are all on Carmen."
15,5.0,1.0, POLSC550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,One cool dude
16,5.0,4.0, POLSC550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"Take this class, it is challenging enough but interesting as well. Wendt is a wonderful prof and super helpful if you go to office hours. If you are a poli sci major at OSU, do no miss out!"
17,4.5,3.0, POLI550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"This is the BEST class and prof I have ever had. He is a renowned Political Scientist and it is easy to see why after taking his class. He is organized, intelligent and straight-forward. This class is a must-take, especially if you are poli sci at OSU!"
18,2.0,5.0, PS550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"Wendt is interesting but that's about it.  Worst class I've taken at OSU in 3 yrs as an honors student.  Grading is not hard, but, rather, incomprehensible (note a scant and vague policy in syllabus). Material is interesting and easy to understand.  Poor consistency of TA grading.  Not a hard course (still pulled a good grade) .  A bad course."
19,4.5,4.0, PS550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"Fantastic lecturer, intelligent and surprisingly easy going.  I feel privileged to have taken a class with him!"
20,5.0,4.0, PS550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,WENDT,"Professor Wendt is amazing. He is incredibly organized and communicates the subject matter extremely clearly. He allows ample time for participation also. While you need to study and do the readings to get good grades on the exams, the class is definitely well worth it. I have learned much more about international theory from Wendt. Take his class!"
