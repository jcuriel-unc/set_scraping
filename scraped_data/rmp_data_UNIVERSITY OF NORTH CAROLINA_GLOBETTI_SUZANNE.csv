1,5.0,2.0, POLI209,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUZANNE,GLOBETTI,"I absolutely love Globetti. I was pretty nervous to take this class because of the Stata element, but it ended up being my favorite class. Globetti is almost always accessible outside of class and gives the best feedback of any professor I've had. She has definitely been my favorite prof at UNC "
2,5.0,3.0, POLI209,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUZANNE,GLOBETTI,"Prof Globetti is a great person and teacher. She really cares about her students and works incredible hard to make sure we all understand and get the information we need. The material is tricky, especially if your not computer savvy, but she will work with you and is great."
3,5.0,4.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUZANNE,GLOBETTI,"A super caring professor. She will memorize every detail you wrote in the introduction. Professor Globetti gives amazing lectures, which are never boring. You will learn a lot from her lectures. If you don't miss the class before a holiday or a break, she will tell you the answer to the bonus question on your exams. So, don't miss her lectures!"
4,5.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUZANNE,GLOBETTI,"Professor Globetti is incredibly kind, and very willing to be helpful to her students. She made the most of content that was not always that exciting, and went through the material logically and efficiently."
5,5.0,3.0, POLI209,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUZANNE,GLOBETTI,"Dr. Globetti was probably the nicest professor I've ever had. She was incredibly accessible, would reach out to me frequently, and was always there whenever I needed help. In a course with inherently difficult content she made it easy to understand and was incredibly helpful in making sure we actually learned. Great all-around person and professor!"
6,5.0,3.0, POLI209,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUZANNE,GLOBETTI,"Prof Globetti gave extensions freely and clarified any topics covered on assignments before you turned them in. There's lots of reading but you can get by without doing it all, and she gives warnings about what's going to be on assignments/exams so you're never caught off guard. She's also just very nice/funny so her lectures are interesting!"
7,5.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUZANNE,GLOBETTI,I absolutely loved having Professor Globetti this semester! She is extremely caring and wants you to do well in the class. It is important to do the readings or at least understand the content within them for the tests. Overall the class is a great introduction to political science and is good for gen-eds.
8,5.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUZANNE,GLOBETTI,"Prof Globetti cares a lot about what she teaches and her students. Grading is pretty lenient, expectations are clear, and she is more than willing to help you succeed in every way possible. I would definitely recommend taking her class"
9,5.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUZANNE,GLOBETTI,"Prof. Globetti is one of the kindest professors Ive ever had at unc. She genuinely cares about your well-being and will do anything she can to help you. Class consists of 2 papers, 3 exams, and class participation, but she offers a lot of extra credit."
10,5.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUZANNE,GLOBETTI,"In this class, you will need to read a lot, participate, and be a decent writer to get an A. The readings are talked about in the exams, so keep up. The lectures are interesting and include current-day news. The professor cares about your grade as well so if you are struggling, make sure to ask questions."
