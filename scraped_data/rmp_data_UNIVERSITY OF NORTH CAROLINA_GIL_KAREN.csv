1,5.0,2.0, PSYC504,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KAREN,GIL,"She's so nice and caring. Assignments are easy and you only have to do ten throughout the semester, and there's one big project that will start near the beginning of the semester and is due in the middle of the semester which reduces the stress greatly during finals and big project seasons. Frequent group work and quick presentations during class."
2,5.0,2.0, PSYC504,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KAREN,GIL,"Dr. Gil was a joy to have!! Like someone else said, she assigns the big project at the beginning of the semester to make midterm and final season more manageable. She is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, which shows in her lectures! She also is very accessible outside of class and is happy to help you if you need it."
3,5.0,1.0, PSYC504,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KAREN,GIL,"Y'all hating on Dr. Gil for no reason. The assignments are super easy. Some of them require coming to class and doing small group discussions, but they're graded for completion. The project is simple, just put effort into it. Literally just study the powerpoint and read the required chapters for the tests! Plus Dr. Gil is so nice and personable."
4,5.0,1.0, PSYC504,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KAREN,GIL,"The harsh reviews are mind-blowing. She was the most understanding professor I've had at UNC. Complete 10 assignments for 20% of your grade, she front-loads the semester so stress decreases with time. Attendance isn't mandatory but some assignments require you to be in class to complete them. Assignments are graded by a checkmark. I recommend it."
5,1.0,5.0, PSYC504,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KAREN,GIL,She was probably the meanist teacher I've ever had. I had some one on one time with her and she was grunting loudly about how unhappy she was to help me. She made snarky comments to me. She was a tougher grader. 
6,1.0,4.0, PSYC504,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KAREN,GIL,"The content is interesting, but her lectures were extremely boring. She is definitely a harsh grader when it comes to the exams. I thought they were unfairly short with less than ten questions. Obviously, just missing one question sets you back a lot. She also wants extremely detailed short answers. Take another psyc class."
7,3.0,3.0, PSYC504,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KAREN,GIL,"This class is low key hard, Gil is a tough grader. She looks for specific details and information on exams. You really have to do the readings and take thorough notes or be really good at skimming the textbook if you want a decent grade in this class. Be sure to read the research articles as well and take notes about them. Assignments are easy."
8,2.0,4.0, PSYC504,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KAREN,GIL,"Not gonna lie, I was super excited for this class and did not enjoy it at all. Her exams are all super niche, making you memorize paper author names, and don't represent what we learn. She is also not super up front with communication in an online class setting and I feel kind of just along for the ride. I'd recommend taking another elective."
9,3.0,4.0, PSYC504,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KAREN,GIL,"I would def take another elective if you can. Tests were very short and asked us about oddly specific details from the textbook or our slides, and did not represent a majority of what we learned in class."
10,3.0,4.0, PSYC504,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KAREN,GIL,"Take another higher level psyc class if you can. Exams are super short, making it hard to get an A. Final exam was hard making you memorize 18 unnecessary articles, when in reality you only need to know like 5. Very boring at the least and not worth it. There was one lecture that was interesting & it happened to be a guest lecturer, not her lecture"
11,3.0,4.0, PSYC504,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KAREN,GIL,"I was really excited about the idea of this class as I want to do something close to health psychology postgrad. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I felt like the grading criteria was oddly specific and we didn't cover much content as we focused so much on memorization. I wish I would have taken a different upper-level psychology class."
