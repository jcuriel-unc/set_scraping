1,4.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"Lectures were very long, often 40 mins to an hour (which was hard to sit through considering it was an online class and there were no closed caption available). His homework assignments were weighed a lot so if you missed one your grade would tank. However exams weren't too difficult, a lot of memorization but that was it."
2,5.0,3.0, PSYC1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"I found his dry sense of humor to be great. Overall the class was pretty easy to get into and the assignments given were always straight to the point. He can be a bit tough to contact outside of class though, time between emails can be quite a while."
3,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,A good professor who enjoys what he does. Sometimes dull but some subject matters are just dull.
4,5.0,4.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"He genuinely seems to care about teaching and was always amicable. While his course was a lot to handle due to the amount of material and lectures, he was very organized and responded to emails the day of. Putting in the time and effort to study pays off. Earning an A is 100% possible as long as you stay on track and ask questions as they arise."
5,4.0,5.0, STATISTICSPSYC,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"Ive taken two of his classes so far, intro psych and stats. His stats was very very time consuming and extremely lecture and homework heavy. However, I still managed to finish with an A as hes super helpful and very clear in what he expects. He tends to take a while to answer emails but tends to be lenient and usually curves tests."
6,3.0,3.0, PSYC1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"The class was neutral. The only ""textbook"" used included online articles. He has VERY long lectures that you MUST listen to completely. I also recommend taking notes while watching as well (helps for exams). As for writing assignments, there were only about 4-5 and were required to be about a page long. The only assignments were quizzes and exams!"
7,5.0,2.0, PSYC1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,Lectures are really interesting and usually funny/entertaining. He gives out a paper at the beginning of every unit with exact specifics of what you'll be tested on. Attendance is barely a requirement as he posts all his lectures online at the beginning of the semester.
8,5.0,2.0, PSYC1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"A great professor. Gives numerous chances for extra credit, take advantage of them. Will finish with a low A. Tests are multiple choice, very few homework assignments that take 5 minutes max. If you halfway study for exams youll be fine."
9,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"Take advantage of all extra credit opportunities and study for the exams. He gives you the power point slides, but be sure to take extra notes on them."
10,5.0,4.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"Funny guy, realistic, took a lot away from this class. Make sure to pay attention and go to class every time or you will sink."
11,5.0,4.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,I enjoyed taking his class. You should go to class and study for exams. Take advantage of extra credit. Overall pretty easy class
12,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"Was a very easy going professor, lectures were never boring.  You rarely have out of class assignments, but if you do they are very quick and easy.  I would definitely recommend, Dr. Shaffer is very humorous and very understanding."
13,3.0,3.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,This class isn't difficult If you have a strong foundation in math if you don't I would recommend rectifying those problems before taking this class. Study and you will do well. He is very understanding.
14,3.5,3.0, 11012220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"Had him for my psych 1100 and my data analysis course. He's a very reasonable professor. And to all the people that said his tests are extremely hard, it's just because you didn't study. Every class I've had with him had two groups, the ones who studied and averaged an A on tests, and those who didn't and blamed him for their failures. "
15,3.5,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,Tests are confusing but was an interesting class and he is a nice guy.
16,3.5,2.0, PSYC1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"Shaffer was my favorite professor this semester. His lectures aren't boring, he offers a good amount of extra credit, and the tests are not difficult if you look at the notes. He always tells you exactly what you need to know. If you didn't do well, that was solely your fault for not studying. Textbook is not necessary."
17,4.5,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"Attendance is not required, but I recommend going to every class.  There is a lot of important material that are in the lectures and not in the notes available online.  Test are hard, but are curved.  Recommend spending a few days studying.  HW ends up being worth more than the tests so if you're not a test taker HW can make up for it."
18,1.0,5.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,Doesn't respond to emails.  Exams are hard and take all day to complete.
19,1.5,5.0, STATISTICSPSYC,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,"Ignores emails asking for help.  Homework load is excessive to the point my other classes were affected.  Others including myself have had to skip classes in other subjects in order to finish his homeworks on time.  He is not flexible whatsoever.  Exams are on Friday 6amto9pm, you have to work or go to school? Tough luck!"
20,4.0,2.0, PSY110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENNIS,SHAFFER,I enjoyed his class. He doesn't take attendance. He has a sense of humor. If you read your power point notes everyday from class or online you will do good on exam. Quizes are online and would recommend using notes and all time allowed. He curves test and your final grade.
