1,2.0,4.0, PSYCH4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,"Materials laid out in a digestible format, major concepts clearly outlined. Long boring unhelpful lectures. Most learning happens out of class. Questions usually met with disdain, he gets defensive/mean/weird if you are confused? Get ready to work hard. Extra credit for going to lecture, open book quizzes, collaborative homework's, and tough exams."
2,1.0,5.0, PSYCH4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,Lectures from minute to minute of 1 hr 20 min class. No breaks. Have to take many notes during class. Uses unfamiliar examples so it is difficult to understand. Decision making is a statistic class. NOT a psychology class. It has almost nothing to do with psychology. Do not take if you are a senior and wanting a low work class.  
3,5.0,4.0, PSYCH4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,"Professor Dekay is a very approachable professor and will take whatever time out of his day that he has to help you understand the material. His exams are hard, but he will offer regrades if you defend your answers. He genuinely loves to teach and explains the material in depth"
4,3.0,1.0, PSYCH2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,"Dr. Dekay changed the curriculum of this class, so I was in the pilot group. Things were poorly organized and he frequently waited until the night before to make our exams, rendering any questions we had about format or content useless. However, he was very flexible and took student feedback into account, which was nice. Grading scale is flexible."
5,1.0,5.0, PSYCH4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,Worst professor Ive ever had in the psych department (my major). Had a test average of 50% for almost every exam and would yell at us for being dumb and incompetent. Lectures make absolutely no sense. Got defensive and weird when asked questions. 15 of students in the groupme voted that they were failing the class the day before the final.
6,3.0,5.0, PSYCH2220H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,DeKay is a nice guy and can be helpful. Spends all of his class time lecturing and can go on and on about one topic for a really long time. Out of touch with technology for someone teaching a stats class that uses programming. Assumes that you know all of the basics already even though it's a foundational stats class.
7,3.0,3.0, PSYCH2220H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,"Dr. Dekay seems like a really nice guy; this is his first semester teaching 2220H and it very clearly shows. His exams don't necessarily match what you have homework on (you use a coding software called R but you don't code for the exams). He tends to go on tangents when asked a question, but overall, he's okay. He responds to emails quickly too."
8,1.0,4.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,"Typically if you do not come to class, you're screwed. Most of the exams, even when studied for, were difficult. Also has a weird grading system and quizzes/homework are a low percent of the grade."
9,4.0,2.0, PSYCH4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,"Pretty good professor, just a boring and tough course. Not much homework but when we did have some it was always easy. Exams are way harder than the HW and you have to put in a lot of effort into understanding the material on your own to get an A/B but its not impossible."
10,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,"Few homeworks and quizzes, but they're not too hard and there's a lot of help available. The material involves a small amount of statistics, but really not deeper than introductory knowledge. He is very funny, helpful, and understanding. Genuinely tries to keep the class engaged and interested. Often encourages independent thought."
11,3.0,4.0, PSY508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,"Professor DeKay is a great professor, he really cares about stats. If you have the option to take this class or to take another I would highly suggest thinking about how much you like stats. I am not a stats person so I had a really hard time in this class. I also highly suggest going to class, I did not and it really hurt my grade in the end."
12,4.5,1.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,"Very interesting class, but it's a long lecture so it is difficult to sit through. A lot of people had trouble with the tests for some reason, but I thought they were fair and I found that reading trough lecture slides was sufficient to study from and I got an A on all three tests. I didn't need the book at all."
13,4.5,3.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,attendance wasn't mandatory but he did give pop quizzes which REALLY end up helping your grade! he was a good professor but taught dry material which was difficult to sit through. don't take him early in the morning!
14,4.5,3.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,I really like this professor.  He makes the lectures interesting and brings cookies to class on test days!  Good job at relating the material to the real world.  This class is fun because it's so diverse.  If I had to classify it-it would be labeled something like: stat/econ/business/psych/philosophy 508.  GREAT PROFESSOR! Take his class.
15,5.0,1.0, PSYCH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,"I only took this class because it was a major requirement and I have no interests in stats, but I learned a lot. He's a good teacher that gives you everything you need to do well on the tests. Carmen homework was time consuming and a pain, but other than that the class was really easy and didn't require much work. I would definitely recommend him."
16,4.0,2.0, PSY508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIKE,DEKAY,"His teaching style is ok, it's long for a 2 hour session, keeps the stats pretty interesting and clarifies whatever. Pretty approachable. Tests are easy but make sure to read because some essays answers may be ONLY found in the book but go to lecture, it's necessary to fully learn all the algorithms. Problem sets aren't bad at all, good prof, 8/10"
