1,5.0,3.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"Unah is very passionate about constitutional law and the Supreme Court. He is an amazing professor, and all of the readings are case studies. I highly recommend taking this class if you're passionate about the supreme court or case precedent. Many of the people who expressed dislike for the class were people simply taking it for a credit."
2,4.0,2.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"I love this man. While he is pretty disorganized, his tests are fair and he is very passionate about the subject matter. I am a super type A person and still felt that I learned a lot even with the disorganization. He is so funny and really cares about his students. "
3,1.0,2.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"While the material was interesting, Professor Unah was not a great instructor. He was late, disorganized, and unclear. Lectures consisted of unrelated tangents and opportunities to flex his ego. At times it seemed like he was more interested in trying to prove how cool he was instead of properly preparing us for exams/assignments. I would avoid."
4,2.0,3.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"Professor Unah as a person is fantastic, but as an educator he is not great. He's clearly smart and empathetic, but his disorganization, fixation on certain topics, and tendency to ramble meant some classes covered absolutely nothing of substance. The tests and papers are also surprisingly difficult. Nice man, but I'd find someone else if you can."
5,1.0,4.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"Don't want to disrespect the professor but can't advise anyone to take this class Professor was often late to class, weeks behind the syllabus, never replied to emails, after the final a paper from October has not been graded now December no idea what grade I will get. Quizzes in class random, numerous spelling mistakes in the final. etc etc. "
6,5.0,3.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"I don't know why all of the reviews for Dr. Unah are so bad, I think he's funny. I took POLI 416 with him during the Fall semester of 2022 and I loved him and this class. If you do the readings and take notes on the textbooks, you can easily get A's on quizzes and exams. "
7,2.0,3.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,Unah is a very kind person and the content he taught was fascinating. It was difficult to be in this class because of his lack of structure in class meetings. Many class periods went wasted discussing meaningless things which led us to be very behind on the syllabus. Tests are weighed VERY heavily with the final being almost half the grade.
8,1.0,3.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"An absolute clown of a professor. Completely disorganized and the students suffer from his lack of professionalism. Gives a quiz 5 minutes before the final exam because he forgot to give it to us when we had an appropriate amount of time for it. Doesnt respond to students comments or concerns, shows up late, rambles, terrible content. horrendous."
9,2.0,3.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,The most unorganized class I have taken. The class was consistently confused and was given little to no guidelines on how to prepare for anything. The tests were often filled with random trivia and the schedule set in the syllabus was completely inconsistent with what occurred. Overall I am let down because the content of the class is interesting.
10,3.0,1.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,He gave a quiz 5 minutes before the final exam. That's all.
11,2.0,3.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,Professor Unah is really nice but horribly disorganized. We were consistently over a month behind. His tests are hard and he often will put random questions on there that he never spoke about and expects us to know the answers. He also doesn't really budge on any of his test questions even when they're obviously unclear and not written well.
12,2.0,2.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"Unah is nice and cares about his students, the material was interesting, and exams were straightforward. Not sure if it was the online format, but I never knew where we were on the syllabus or what we were supposed to have read for that day. We also barely received guidance for our term papers. Maybe this class would have been better in person."
13,2.0,2.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"Disorganized to the point that its inconsiderate of your time as a student. Almost two weeks have passed since the final and a grade has yet to be submitted, which could affect my GPA if it is not changed soon. Unreachable by email, unclear instruction during class time. Avoid."
14,2.0,3.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"Unah was probably the most disorganized professor I've had at UNC. We were given few guidelines about our final papers, and we ended the semester really far behind the syllabus because he got distracted a lot and spent 4 classes on statistical analysis. he also never responded to emails, including to confirm the date of our final exam."
15,2.0,3.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"Not sure if it's the online format or what, but quite honestly, Dr. Unah is not great. I have never met anyone in my adult life that wears their responsibilities on their sleeve like Unah. He's always late, never prepared, cold calls during class, doesn't offer helpful feedback, and gives pop quizzes worth a good portion of your grade."
16,2.0,2.0, POLI416,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"Professor Unah, Im sure, is a wonderful person. However, he is the most unorganized, uninspiring lecturers Ive ever had. The textbooks are mandatory but dont bother reading because hes just going to copy word for word haphazardly slapped on a PowerPoint for our viewing pleasure. Would not recommend."
17,5.0,2.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"Unah is an amazing professor-caring, knowledgeable, smart. His only flaw is organization; he tends to get excited and spends too much time on certain topics and neglects others. However, he does account for this in exams and quizzes. Do the readings, come to class, you'll be fine. A pretty lenient grader too!"
18,4.0,4.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"The only reason I don't rate Unah a ""5"" is because of his organization and timeliness. He is a gem of a guy, but sometimes is unprepared and neglects to provide timely feedback for your grades. I didn't really know where I stood in the class until final grades came out. All said, Unah is still a good prof. Very knowledgable. Very enthusiastic."
19,4.0,3.0, POLI202,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"Professor Unah is the most caring professor I've had at Carolina. He genuinely cares about his students and the material he teaches. However, he is incredibly unorganized. He often came to class not knowing what the topic on the syllabus was. I wouldn't recommend this for a freshman, but definitely take one of his classes at some point!"
20,3.0,3.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ISAAC,UNAH,"Unah's super kind and a whiz on the material. But we got off topic all the time. We weren't tested on stuff we didn't cover tho. Getting good test grades is key to your grade here (midterm 33%, final 37%). Multiple choice is hard to study for, often trivia stuff. Need to ace the short answers. Take good notes and stay ready for occasional quizzes!"
