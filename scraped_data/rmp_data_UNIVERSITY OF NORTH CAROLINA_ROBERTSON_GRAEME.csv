1,5.0,1.0, POLI235,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GRAEME,ROBERTSON,"This review is for a 400-level politics class... Dr. Robertson prepares you for a political career in the world beyond the university, and that gift is priceless. Many classes you take in college will be of no use to you in the future, but Graeme is fantastic and brilliant. One of my favorite professors of all time. "
2,5.0,3.0, POLI235,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GRAEME,ROBERTSON,He is a very nice teacher and is always willing to help students understand their work.
3,4.0,3.0, POLI235,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GRAEME,ROBERTSON,"Interesting class but gets harder and more theoretical after the midterm. Lots of reading, but I managed an A without ever once doing any of the reading.A is set at 94; he will not round up anything. This was the Fall 2020 COVID semester, and it seems he gave everyone a perfect participation grade this semester. May be different in the future."
4,5.0,4.0, POLI235,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GRAEME,ROBERTSON,"Contrary to some of the previous reviews, I found him to be reliable and clear in his explanations and expectations. He is a knowledgeable and objective figure for anyone interested in Russia and the post-Soviet sphere, and can provide good insights. He is enthusiastic, and I think appreciates a genuine effort from anyone who applies themselves."
5,3.0,4.0, POLI235,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GRAEME,ROBERTSON,"Professor Robertson is awesome in that he is very passionate about the material, and extremely knowledgeable. However, he's seldom available during office hours and doesn't seem to care much about how well students do. I loved his class and I think he's an awesome person, but I struggled a lot with his confusing instructions and disorganization."
6,2.5,3.0, POLI235,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GRAEME,ROBERTSON,"Professor Robertson is a nice man who, like most other UNC professors, knows his topic, Russian and post-Soviet politics, like the back of his hand. His lectures were simple and easy to follow. He does not believe in overcomplicating something that does not have to be and he has a gift for explaining things in a clear and comprehensible way."
7,5.0,2.0, POLI235,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GRAEME,ROBERTSON,"Great class, but lots of readings and workload. Exams are based on the quality of the argument, that means a lot of memorization and arguing your point."
8,5.0,4.0, POLI195,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GRAEME,ROBERTSON,Great teacher. Makes subjects interesting and has a lot of fun.
9,4.5,3.0, POLI055,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GRAEME,ROBERTSON,"Class is moderately difficult, but he helps fudge your grades for the better.  He's new and that shows with the occassional mistake in assinging work.  However, he is EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL,EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE about soviet politics.  If you're interested in world politics I recomend him."
