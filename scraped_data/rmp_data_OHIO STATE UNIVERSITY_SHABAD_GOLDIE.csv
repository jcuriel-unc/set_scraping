1,3.0,2.0, POLS100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,"Very nice, however her lectures are all discussion and can be boring. The exams are pretty easy (she tells you exactly what will be on them), and the class isn't very hard."
2,3.0,4.0, PS530,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,"Shabad is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, she's not that great a lecturer and over assigns readings. On the other, she has an encyclopaedic knowledge of East European politics. Both classes I've been in, she shows a movie. Clearly defined workload (two essay exams, 10-15 pages of writing). Only take if the subject matter interests you."
3,2.0,2.0, PS5972,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,"Rambles during lecture, doesn't facilitate effective in-class discussions, no real course structure."
4,1.5,1.0, PS100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,"VERY Difficult and unpleasant person to deal with; does not answer emails on a regular basis; I received an A and did not find the class to be terribly difficult grade-wise; although there was a lot of reading, none of it was very difficult- mostly one-liner articles."
5,2.5,4.0, PSH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,"Very advisable to skip reading if you want a decent grade, but not if you want to understand the material.  Will not give out A's, but will arbitrarily hand out A-'s.  Don't know of anyone who did worse than a B, so, if you're comfortable with a glass ceiling on A's, a good class.  EXTREMELY tiring though, not sure if it was her fault or the subj."
6,2.5,3.0, H100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,Don't waste your time reading the huge course packet she makes you buy. She picks terrible readings and doesn't hold you acocuntable for knowing the content. The class is ok...but she's just not a very likable lady.
7,1.0,5.0, 100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,"I pity anyone who has to take a(nother) class with this woman- she's the worst; I don't mind a hard challenging professor, but she's terribly unpleasant to deal with; she always has a nasty attitude and is off-putting in the extreme; talks down to students."
8,2.5,3.0, POLISCIH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,"Her lectures are generally disorganized and boring.    I wouldn't recommend saying much-she usually misunderstands what students say.  However, she is a knowledgeable instructor and a fair grader.  Here's a tip:  if she starts shouting, she's saying something she wants you to write down."
9,1.0,4.0, POLISCIH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,Terrible class. Incredibly boring and she expects you to know a ton about international politics coming in. Avoid this class with her at all costs.

11,3.0,4.0, POLSCIH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,"There was this one class of hers I found really interesting but it must have been a fluke. To sum it up: assumes a lot of prior knowledge, you'll get really good at pretending to be awake, gives all essay tests, assigns readings you shouldn't do, and assigns a lot of papers. I got a B+!"
12,1.0,2.0, H100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,The class was eye-crossingly dull but easy.  She isn't very inspiring or entertaining.  She has a boring NPR-esque tone that puts you to sleep.  She talks in long incoherant sentences much like John Kerry.  Reader Beware!
13,5.0,4.0, POLISCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,"She knows her stuff.  Class is challenging, interesting."
14,2.0,5.0, POLYH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GOLDIE,SHABAD,GET AWAY
