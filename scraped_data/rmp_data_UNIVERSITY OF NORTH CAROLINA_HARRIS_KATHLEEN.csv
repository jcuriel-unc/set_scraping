1,5.0,3.0, SOCI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,HARRIS,"She really cares about seeing her students succeed and really wants us to learn. Her grading was totally realistic, I always knew exactly what was expected of me and we had really great discussions in this class. She's so knowledgeable and fun to learn from altogether. One of my favorites."
