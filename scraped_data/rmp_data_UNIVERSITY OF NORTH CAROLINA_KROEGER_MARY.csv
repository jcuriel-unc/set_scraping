1,1.0,5.0, POLI406,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARY,KROEGER,"Avoid at all costs. One 15 page paper determined much of grade, with very little feedback provided (no feedback provided on drafts, one class period to work on paper and professor wasn't present). Ended up with a B- on paper and never saw score for final exam. Cannot recommend strongly enough that you take any other class to satisfy 400+ POLI req."
2,5.0,3.0, POLI406,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARY,KROEGER,"Mary was super sweet, caring, and understanding!  Her lectures can get a little plain at times, but overall great professor.  Willing to provide help outside of class.  Tests were open note just make sure to answer questions fully.  We had one 15 page research paper due at the end, but she makes sure we keep up by submitting topic and rough draft."
3,5.0,3.0, POLI406,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARY,KROEGER,"This class does have a lot of readings, but she makes it very easy to understand the readings by giving us questions we discuss in the class. She is probably the nicest professor I have had here, and I am a Junior. Nothing to pay for and not much work that is graded, but it is not hard to do well if you keep up with readings (I did not) :(."
4,4.0,2.0, POLI406,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARY,KROEGER,"This class only had 2 papers and 2 exams, but none were hard at all and the papers were super interesting. Mary's lectures can be a little dense at times but she covers a really good amount of material. The readings are used in class but not on exams. Overall she's a good professor."
5,5.0,3.0, POLI406,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARY,KROEGER,"Such a great professor!! Really passionate about her research and what she teaches, and she's such a kind and engaging professor."
6,5.0,2.0, POLI201,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARY,KROEGER,"Prof. Kroeger is very energetic and invested in the content of the class, and is an overall delight of a teacher. Very understanding and would reach out to you personally to congratulate you on impressive papers. 3 papers worth 20% each plus a final exam make up the bulk of the grade, but the concepts were easy and she isn't a tough grader!"
