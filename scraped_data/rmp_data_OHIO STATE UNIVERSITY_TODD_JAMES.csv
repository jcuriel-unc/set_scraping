1,3.0,4.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,TODD,"The class is comprised of 3 exams, REP assignment and a term paper. Exams are graded very strictly. Professor Todd made it clear that he was planning to drop my lowest exam, as many on here had said he has done. This did not happen, and after asking to see the breakdown of the grades and get some kind of explanation, I was denied. Disappointed."
2,5.0,1.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,TODD,"Dr. Todd was a pretty chill professor. There aren't many tests and there was never homework besides the term paper/presentation, but he was generally a pretty easy grader as long as you show that you know the information decently well. Tip: start working on the study guides as you go through the chapters instead of cramming it in before the exam."
3,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,TODD,"Proff Todd is best described as a ""total bro"". He explains everything so clearly and has met and worked with half the people they teach about in the book. Very understanding. I bombed one exam and did amazing on the other two so he just dropped the bad  one because I asked him nicely and participated in class. I would absolutely recommend."
4,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,TODD,"Prof Todd was one of the nicest professors I've had. Really into psych and makes the class easy to understand. As long as you do the study guides, you're bound to ace the class. After unfortunately mixing up exam dates, I recieved a very low grade for one of the exams. I explained the sitaution and he dropped the exam from my overall grade. Amazing"
