1,5.0,3.0, MATH2255,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,he is very considerate for students. I would definitely take his class again
2,5.0,2.0, MATH2255,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,The greatest Math professors in Math department. He explains math concepts clearly and did many examples in class which helps a lot. Exams are fair and he graded it fairly. Just do the homework you will do well in this class.
3,5.0,2.0, MATH2255,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,"100% the best professor I've ever had in the Math Dept at OSU. Genuinely cares about his students, even past their understanding of the material. Always happy to meet outside class/office hours if you ask, always answers questions during lecture, and cares about the students learning and enjoying the class. No harsh grading either. 12/10."
4,5.0,2.0, MATH2255,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,"Professor Tien makes the content of the course much more easier than I expected. His lectures are inspirational and informative, and he is also a very approachable person."
5,5.0,3.0, MATH2255,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,"The best professor I've ever had. Informative lectures, quick responses, and clear explanations. Take him if you want to pass the course and truly learn something."
6,5.0,3.0, MATH2255,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,"Dr. Tien is who you want for this class. Easily one of the best professors I've ever had. He could not have explained the content of this course in a more clear, easy-to-understand way. Very friendly and caring person as well. Overall, 10/10 professor"
7,5.0,3.0, MATH2255,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,"Prof. Tien is a gem, probably the best math teacher I've had. He's down-to-Earth and really cares about you understanding the material. Everything he says makes sense and if you still don't get it, he's pretty accessible outside of class. Highly recommend him!"
8,5.0,3.0, MATH2255,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,Amazing professor. Would definitely recommend. Take him!!!!
9,5.0,4.0, MATH3345,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,Informative lectures that help clarify material from the textbook. Cares about students a lot and is helpful in office hours. I disliked the class itself but the professor was so good that he made it bearable.
10,5.0,3.0, MATH3345,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,Joe made a relatively difficult subject very easy to understand. This was my first exposure to mathematical proofs and I'm very glad I had Joe as a lecturer. The exams were very fair and he's a caring person in general so I would definitely recommend.
11,5.0,3.0, MATH3345,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,Professor Tien is a great math teacher. This class is all proofs and could be very challenging with the wrong professor. Joe will go over the same proof 5 times if he thinks the class doesn't understand it. Very caring and wants everyone in the class to enjoy math (he does math riddles in class sometimes). Book for the class is helpful and only $10
12,4.0,2.0, MATH3345,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,"Dr. Tien is a caring and passionate teacher and makes sure his students stay engaged and succeed. Math 3345 content is very proof-based and not always the most interesting for non-math majors, but he does his best. His lectures are very helpful and exams and homework is fair. Class may be difficult if it's your first time doing proofs."
13,4.5,2.0, MATH2177,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,You really don't need to go to lecture because he just derives equations and it makes everything seem so confusing. If you just do the homework and make sure you understand it all you are truly guaranteed an A on the exams.
14,3.0,3.0, MATH2177,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,WAY TOO MUCH THEORY!! He never did examples which were helpful. Could have skipped lecture every day and just read the textbook.
15,3.5,2.0, MATH415,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,"Joe is a decent professor. His lectures aren't super helpful because he goes into too much theory.  However, he does try to ""dumb down"" differential equations for the class, which helps a lot. His exams are fair, with some being pretty easy and others being pretty challenging. Overall, he is a good professor and you should do fine in the class"
16,5.0,3.0, MATH415,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH,TIEN,"Joe Tien is by far the best math teacher I have had. His explanations to differential equations start basic, and he gradually increases the complexity. He keeps students engaged, and prepares you for applied Diff EQ. Test are very fair. Differential Eqns are a difficult topic regardless of the teacher, but Tien makes it as easy as possible."
