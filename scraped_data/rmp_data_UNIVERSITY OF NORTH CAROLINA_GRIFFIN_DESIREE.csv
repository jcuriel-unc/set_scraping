1,5.0,2.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"This has probably been my favorite class taken so far at UNC! Dr. Griffin cares so much about her students and the subject matter, and it shows in the lectures and projects. Exams are online and very easy as long as you take notes in class and pay attention. "
2,5.0,3.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"Her lectures were really interesting and engaging! She had a fun group project that was super easy and if you put in the time and effort into the papers you could get a 100. The exams are appilcation base but taken online and open notes!! I would so take Dr,Griffin again!!"
3,5.0,2.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"I can't think of many UNC professors better than Dr. Griffin! I have little interest in clinical psych, but she still made the class engaging and one of my favorites this semester. All of her tests and assignment are straight forward and easy to do well on, and they do a great job making sure the material is clear. Take a class with her if you can!"
4,4.0,4.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"Dr. Griffin is great, interesting in lecture and at answering questions. Exams are online. Only con is that in 242 we have a project worth 36% of our grade and the grading on that is tough, due to TAs. "
5,5.0,3.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,Really wonderful professor and super understanding. Case studies are graded a little harshly depending on your TA so be aware of that since it is a large part of your grade. Lectures are very interesting and easy to be engaged! Wonderful professor!
6,5.0,3.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"I love Dr. Griffin! I took 245 with her this semester and I'll be taking 242 with her next semester. She is very knowledgable and has worked in many different clinical settings so she has a lot of experience. She is also very sweet! I highly recommend taking 245 with her, it's a super interesting class and she executes very well. 5/5 quality!"
7,5.0,3.0, 245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,The absolute best professor I have ever had. Dr. Griffin is absolute BRILLIANT -- she knows exactly how to teach in way that is clear and so easy to digest. She is ORGANIZED!!! She provides clear and organized modules and have so much helpful tools for studying. Dr. Griffin is the level professors should be compared to.
8,5.0,3.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,Dr. Griffin is great! She made lectures super interesting and offered 24-hr grace periods for almost all of her assignments. She's very caring and really wants to see her students succeed! 100% recommend her for any psychology course she offers (ESPECIALLY 242!).
9,5.0,2.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"Take 242 with Dr. Griffin!! She makes the material super interesting. You can tell she wants the best for her students and her class/homework just makes sense, she doesn't try to be difficult. She also brings in people to give talks which are super interesting. If you follow the rubrics and do the work, you will get an A."
10,5.0,2.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"Dr. Griffin is amazing! 242 has so many components that go into final course grade. Definitely a thorough class to take if you're interested in clinical psychology (guest speakers, hands-on activities, comprehensive readings and application-based questions)"
11,5.0,3.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"Dr. Griffin is a great lecturer, however her test can be very tricky being that it is mainly an application based test,  we had a clinical project that was 32% of our grade, the grading for that was kind of weird but if you followed the samples given it would be an easy A, overall I really recommend her!"
12,5.0,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"dr. griffin is easily one of my favorite professors. she's literally the best lecturer i've ever seen, her lectures are so engaging and i genuinely loved going to this class so much. there's four case study papers (one can be dropped/skipped) but they're super easy too! midterm and final are open-note too :) take a class with her!!!"
13,4.0,3.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"Dr. Griffin was a really nice teacher, but the grading scale for our project that determined 32% of our grade was very unfair, with everyone starting at an 85 and either getting bumped up or bumped down. Her exams were also pretty hard, nothing really prepares you for them but the second one is easier cause you'll know whats coming."
14,5.0,4.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"Dr. Griffin is a fantastic lecturer, and she makes the content in her lessons very interesting. She is constantly being named as a great, highly-recommended professor within the UNC psych majors community. Her tests can be a bit difficult, and there is one weekly reading quiz. Reading quizzes are no problem if you skim the readings!"
15,5.0,3.0, 245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"She's a great teacher, but she does pronounce stimuli as ""stim-you-lee"". Since the word stimuli is brought up a decent bit in the class, if that procuration bothers you, then I would not recommend taking this course. "
16,5.0,3.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,Hands down my all time favorite professor at UNC! Lectures are always very interesting and well organized! Her class never gets boring! Dr. Griffin is also very flexible with assignments by giving a 24 hour grace period for most of them! She is just a phenomenal human being and you can tell she truly cares about her students! Queen status for sure!
17,5.0,3.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"There are no words adequate enough to express what an amazing professor Dr. Griffin is. She is at the top of her field and it is evident in her lectures. She is, without a doubt, my most favorite professor at UNC. Her kind attitude and approachable spirit makes such an impact on any student that has the pleasure of taking her class. ENROLL NOW!!!!!"
18,5.0,3.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR AT UNC!! Dr. Griffin may have a lot of assignments but the assignments are so interesting and are actually kind of fun. There is a group project throughout the semester that is more hands on but it is set up to where if you do it, it will help you succeed in the overall class. Could not recommend her enough. "
19,4.0,4.0, PSYC242,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"I like the class overall. Very interesting topics. She is not so accommodating and understanding. Many people are 0.03%, 0.05% away from the higher letter grade and she would not care about curving. That's my only complaint. Besides that, this class is great. I just wish she cares more about students' future and well-being over grade inflation."
20,5.0,2.0, PSYC514,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DESIREE,GRIFFIN,"First half of the class is about depression, second half about mania. The two largest assignments are the group presentation, and the individual paper on your group's topic which is scaffolded by smaller assignments during the semester. Exams are very fair. Dr. Griffin is a wonderful person who is always friendly and willing to answer any question!"
