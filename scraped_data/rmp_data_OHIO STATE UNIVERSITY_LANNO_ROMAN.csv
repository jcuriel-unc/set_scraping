1,4.0,3.0, EEOB3320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"Professor Lanno has long lectures, and the beginning of the course was difficult. The labs are almost all dissection, so if you have a weak stomach, I do not recommend this course. There was a lot of group projects at the end of the semester that can make or break your grade, choose your lab partners wisely. "
2,3.0,2.0, EEOB3320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"Dr. Lanno was passionate about what he was teaching, but the course structure could use a little work. The lecture material was a lot to learn at once. Some of the exams (practicals) were a month apart, some were barely over a week apart, which sometimes left us not much time to study. The class just felt a little all over the place."
3,1.0,5.0, BIO1114H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"Dr. Lanno makes this class harder than it should be. He gave us 50-page slides a few days before our final without a lecture and half of the final was over that. He could've planned ahead but did not, causing students to cram and fall behind on learning content. His explanations drag on and are confusing, even when a student has a simple question."
4,4.0,5.0, BIO1114H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"Dr. Lanno was an awesome professor. The structure of the class was difficult at the beginning with few assignments and long lectures, but Dr. Lanno is very open to feedback and changed his class delivery to accommodate us. Study for the tests because they make up most of your grade. Labs depend on the TA, but the endophytes project was interesting."
5,4.0,4.0, BIO1114H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,Dr. Lanno is an amazing professor who will do his best to prepare you (though a bit fast ) That said the lab and the semester project are hard and the course content is over whelming. I love bio and I found myself hating this class. If you like bio and want to preserve your sanity dont take this class at 8am! The course is fast and content heavy!
6,4.0,4.0, BIO1114H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"Pretty good professor, kept lectures fairly interesting at 8 am. Good at explaining concepts, and breaks up the lectures with readings and discussion. Study for the second exam early, lots of memorizing. Endophyte project is tough, but doable. Not the best with technology, but tries his best."
7,5.0,3.0, BIO1114H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"Super nice guy and very good teacher! I was always interested in his lectures & they were 80 minutes at 8a.m! He breaks up the class time with discussion and 2-6 page readings that tie the material into current issues. The endophyte project is a lot of work but it's split up over the semester. As others said, start studying for the 2nd test early!"
8,3.0,2.0, BIO1114H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"Dr. Lanno was a good professor, but he wasn't the best at emailing back. He was easy to understand, and although some test questions were poorly written, it was fairly easy to do well."
9,3.0,2.0, BIO3401,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,Wasn't a fan of his module-- because I didn't find toxicology interesting + he used unfamiliar words and it was really hard to pay attention in lecture. He focuses on the oil spill a lot- pretty boring. His exam is fairly easy if you study what he tells you is important (red + blue stuff on slides -- beware he changed this on the slides midway).
10,3.0,3.0, BIO3401,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"He's an okay professor overall. His part of the class consists of listening to lectures and answering graded LGS questions. The lectures were straightforward, and he will highlight important parts before the exam. In my opinion, recitation was a waste of time."
11,3.0,3.0, BIO3401,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,Get points for going to lecture. Exam is poorly written but is manageable to do well on. Lots of points come from showing up to lecture. Lecture is interesting but sometimes gets pretty boring.
12,5.0,2.0, BIO3401,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,Show up for in class assignments. He usually walks you through them for easy points
13,3.5,4.0, BIO3401,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,Dr. Lanno is a nice guy but I wasn't particularly found of his module. I thought that the oil spillHiroshima& Nagasaki stuff was interesting but the rest was really dry because it was mostly bio stats. I felt that hardly any bluered info was on the exam even though he said it would be. The exam wasn't terrible if you study just really random 
14,4.0,2.0, BIO3401,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"Very thorough and makes summary slides so you know what to study. Really good at explaining applicable uses for information in field. Overall, I recommend this professor"
15,5.0,2.0, BIO1114H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,Dr. Lanno was seriously awesome. He legitimately cares about students. He offered plenty of extra credit opportunities. He is an excellent lecturer.
16,3.0,4.0, BIO1114H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"The class seemed easy... until the second exam killed everyone. The first exam was really easy, but he threw us a curveball and made the second exam extremely difficult. Also, like others have said the grading on the small assignments is very  nitpicky which hurts grades in the long run. That being said, Lanno is an overall great professor."
17,4.5,3.0, BIO1114H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"Dr Lanno is a good professor, the material isnt too hard but the way the class is set up makes it nearly impossible to get an A . Get used to a lot of 3 out of 5s on small assignments which add up to kill grades"
18,4.5,3.0, BIO1114H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"The lecturer is extremely good and understandable. However the TA Jessie Wallace is so critical, I think it's absurd that the majority of the class is getting close to no points on drafts of papers which is bringing down grades tremendously."
19,4.0,3.0, BIO1114H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,"Lecturer is fine, and worth taking.  Watch out for TA Jessie Wallace - grading is extremely inconsistent and you will get nickel and dimed on everything.  Getting absurdly low grades on DRAFTs of your paper sections based on trivial things is absolutely ridiculous.  This ruins ths class."
20,5.0,2.0, BIO101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROMAN,LANNO,Really liked him even though i absolutely despise science.  Really wanted students to do well.  We were in 4-person lab groups and I was pulling all the weight in my group so he noticed that and pulled me aside and asked me if i'd like to be put into another group. i said yes and he changed everyones group around...i really appreciated this!!
