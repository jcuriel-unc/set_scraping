Content was fun, and all assignments were chill.  She has a nice grading system; you can drop lowest midterm and 2 HWs.  HW was graded nicely.  The final was easier compared to midterms/LCs.  Make sure to study a bit. We got 1 point EC for final."
2,5.0,3.0, NSCI225,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VICKI,CHANON,"I thought it was a tough class content-wise, especially compared to her PSYC 230 class. But, Dr. Chanon still has teaching down to a science and is an engaging lecturer. Her grading system is incredibly reasonable too, just make sure you really put in the work for the exams. The final is easy compared to them! "

Her grading system is very forgiving. Her exams are very straight forward. Plus, she practically does reviews every day. She also makes the lectures interesting by making what we learned relatable. Highly recommend!!! "
6,5.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VICKI,CHANON,"Professor Chanon is one of the best professors ever. She learned all her ~100 students' names within the first few weeks of class. Her lectures are well-organized, engaging, and fun. Cognitive Psychology requires lots of memorization, but she makes it durable for her students. I have so many good things to say about her. Highly recommend!"

12,5.0,3.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VICKI,CHANON,One of the best at UNC! The way she set up her class was perfect. I feel like I genuinely learnt a lot from the class- the material stuck all semester. Content is cool and she gives great lectures. The 3 tests are kinda challenging but you drop one and the final is easy in comparison. You can miss up to 6 classes without penalty but should catch up

In a way, I literally felt like her office was a safe space for me because of how caring and helpful she was. She has kids which I think helps her have even more of a heart for college students & their well-being. Her lectures are amazing, the class is very organized, and she is so accessible! "
15,5.0,2.0, PSYC330,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VICKI,CHANON,"Dr. Chanon is super sweet. The class was not super difficult so long as you study (especially for the learning checks!) The unique part of this class is the UX BeAM project, which while tedious at times was pretty cool to do. There is pretty regular homework, but you don't necessarily have to read the book. Be sure to study the learning goals! "

You will definitely get an A if you study well!"
