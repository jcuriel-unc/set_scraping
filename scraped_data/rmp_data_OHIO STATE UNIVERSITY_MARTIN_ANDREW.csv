1,3.0,3.0, SOC487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"Andrew was the very definition of ""meh"" as a professor. The only two things I really have to say about him is that he is a very fair/easy grader, and make sure you go to class to get the notes, because they're not online."
2,4.0,1.0, SOC3487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"Dr. Martin is the chillest professor I have ever had. His exams are crazy easy and even though he has a final paper and a final exam, you basically write all of the final paper in recitation throughout the semester and he will tell you word-for-word what to say for some parts. He does do assignments in class for participation. SUPER EASY CLASS."
3,2.0,5.0, SOC3487H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"its only the 2nd month of classes and this class is extremely hard I'm very lost the final research paper is on strikes and thats what the class is based on, I already want to drop it. Recitation sucks as well"
4,4.0,1.0, SOC4000,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,This is literally the easiest class ever.  Andrew even tells you how to correct your papers for a better grade if you need to improve your scores.
5,5.0,1.0, SOC4000H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"Great professor, easy, willing to help with anything, gives extensions if you contact him "
6,4.5,2.0, 3487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,Andrew is a very nice professor. He will answer any and every question you have and is overall very helpful. He seems to be an easy grader. I highly recommend him.
7,4.0,2.0, SOC3487H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"Andrew's a nice guy, and he grades quickly and very fairly. He's got a good sense of humor and responds to emails incredibly fast.   While his rubrics and tests are clear, he doesn't describe assignments well. Very repetitive, mind-numbing lecture. It's offputting that the course totally revolves around his research, but not a bad option overall."
8,4.5,1.0, SOC3487H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"Dr. Martin is one of the best profs I've ever had. He is easy-going (I slept through class one day when we were supposed to turn in an assignment and he left me turn it in that afternoon with no point deductions) and nice. He can be a bit confusing with assignments, but he tells you exactly what will be on the tests."
9,5.0,2.0, SOCH487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,Great teacher. He makes everything clear and I liked the class a lot. Shouldn't be a hard class as long as you show up and read the textbook. He doesn't use slides so make sure you go to class. I learned a great deal from him. Highly recommend.
10,4.5,2.0, SOC487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,He is a very good teacher and I liked him a lot. Yo will learn and he will reward you with a decent grade if you show up... Good teacher!!!
11,5.0,3.0, SOC487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"He's truly one of the good guys.  If you take Andrew Martin, you're taking a course with a passionate guy that loves his kids. He's always in a good mood and while he's not super easy, he wants you to learn. He's also the prof. who will nearly always return your e-mail more quickly than you would ever expect."
12,5.0,3.0, SOC487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"He is very passionate about what he teaches and even though his field may not appeal to everyone, he makes the information interesting. He is extremely helpful and he gives very clear notes. As long as you go to class and the recitations there is no way you can fail."
13,4.5,2.0, SOC487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,He is a very clear teacher who does a good job of making sure the class understands the content and the assignments.
14,3.5,1.0, SOC487H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"Class is boring but easy to get through. Final paper is not fun, very boring, he is not particularly helpful with the outline, tells the class multiple things"
15,4.5,4.0, SOC487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"Not a bad class at all.  Lectures are a boring but just go and you will get an A.  As for the final paper, make sure you start it early.  The literature review and other things can be done way ahead of schedule."
16,5.0,3.0, SOC487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"Andrew is great. He loves to help. He responds to emails very quickly. Yes, his lectures are boring, but he does his best with the material he needs to cover. The final paper on strikes was a drag, but I learned some new things. I'd take his class again."
17,3.5,3.0, SOC487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"Very slow lecture.He could probably finish a lecture in 30 minutes if he went at a normal speed but with the multiple repeatings he stretches out to over an hour.  Everything is clear since he does take forever. Bring some coffee to stayawake, final paper on strikes is boring. Someone should tell him not to drink in the middle ofa sentence annoying"
18,5.0,3.0, SOC487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,Great prof! Likes to help whenever possible. Good lecturer. Final research proposal only on strike activity so kinda on the yawn side of interesting.
19,4.0,2.0, SOC487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,MARTIN,"He's a pretty good teacher. He's a newer professor, so he's still getting the hang of lecturing and whatnot, but he does pretty well with making things clear by using examples and exercises to show us how it can  be used. Only thing I don't like is for the research paper at the end, he makes you do it on strikes, nothing else."
