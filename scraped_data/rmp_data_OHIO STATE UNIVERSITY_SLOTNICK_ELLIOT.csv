1,4.5,2.0, POLSC516,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,"Not sure why everyone thinks this class is so hard, maybe it depends on the T.A. Anyway, I highly recommend some kind of recording device for this class, as lectures consist entirely of him talking. Not the most enthralling class, but if you are pre-law I would seriously consider taking his section of this course. You will learn quite a lot."
2,3.0,5.0, POSC516,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,Professor Slotnick is extremely knowledgeable. The class is challenging because he assigns a huge breadth of reading and his exams ask specific questions. Very popular class among pre-law students.
3,5.0,4.0, POLI516,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,Best professor I have ever had
4,3.0,5.0, POLI516,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,"Pretty intelligent guy, but kind of an ****!  The reading was intense but most of it wasnt too bad as far as content goes.  I had judicial politcs and i got an A- but i worked my ass off for it.  If your up to it, id say take the class. Oh, and if you are a girl, he's a real****so get ready to brown nose for you're grade."
5,1.0,4.0, POL516,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,"I was told that I was ""not college material"" presumably because I did not echo the liberal mantra.  I dropped the class for fear of my grade.  I am now an attorney in a large, sophisticated Ohio law firm."
6,1.0,5.0, PS516,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,That reading was ridiculous!  Everything else wrong in the class pales in comparison to the fact that nobody could ever read that much.
7,1.0,5.0, POLISCI516,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS !!!!
8,3.0,5.0, 58063,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,"Took a class on constitutional law w/him. Hardest class I took in my life. Had to read 200 pages a night for a 500-level, 5-hour class! Buddy, this ain't law school! I am a 3.8 maj. student and get great grades but the work we had to do was just ludicrous"
9,1.0,5.0, 516,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,"How the heck does he grade? He is also very liberal, it is sickening. The material in the course is pretty straight forward, but the exams are very hard, if you get out of the class with a C consider yourself lucky."
10,2.0,5.0, PS516,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,"Getting an A would be miraculous with this guy.  Way too hard to follow.  In lecture, you think you understand what's going on, but when test time rolls around, it's like a foreign languange."

12,2.0,4.0, POLISCI516,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,Class was long and boring and the prof. although intelligent had a completely illogical system of grading.
13,4.5,5.0, JUDPOL,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,"Class was pretty difficult. E is pretty smart, very wordy, but there's some good information. Lots of readings required. Difficult to take notes."
14,3.0,4.0, POLISCI5,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,"Good teacher, very knowledgeable, but grading procedures are completely unfair."

16,1.0,3.0, POLISCI5,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ELLIOT,SLOTNICK,"Has shown up to maybe 4 out of all the classes does not give notes, just rambles"
