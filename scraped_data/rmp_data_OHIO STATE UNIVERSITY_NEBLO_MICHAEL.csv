1,2.0,4.0, POLITSC2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"This class was way too hard for a 2000 level. The lecture videos were only 10 ish minutes and didnt really help me understand anything. Quizzes were really difficult and I went over material multiple times. He didnt give me any feedback on my essays and gave me a really low grade, so I didnt have any way to improve for the final."
2,4.0,4.0, POLISCI2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,His online lectures are amazing & a lot of his quiz questions are phrased word for word on what he said in lecture. Ive never read any of the readings and Ive done fine on his quizzes. His midterm takes a lot of questions from the quizzes so WRITE THEM DOWN. If you do the lectures and take good notes (write exactly what he says) then youre good
3,4.0,3.0, POLISCI2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"Professor Neblo is a really good professor! He always emails back fast, and is very kind when emailing back. His exams are based on in depth responses which the readings are critical to getting a good grade! The quizzes are fair."
4,4.0,4.0, POLISCI2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"He genuinely wants students to do well, and his class is not impossible. That being said, the quizzes are rather difficult for a 2000 level class. The material isn't bad and he does provide guidance for the midterm and final, but still is a rather tough grader. Not a bad class, but certainly not an easy A."
5,3.0,4.0, POLISCI2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,The course consists of a heavy workload of readings! A lot of weekly readings; but it is absolutely possible to get through the class only listening to his lectures. Quizzes are very specific and can be considered hard and tough. Detailed grading for essays. No homework. I do have to say that the curve for this class is amazing though.
6,1.0,4.0, 2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,Such a stupid class. His videos are way too long. Time for quizzes are way too short. You will struggle. I find it hard to believe that a student wrote the good reviews on this site.
7,4.0,2.0, POLISCI2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"No book for the class, he posts the necessary readings on Carmen. However, it is possible to go the whole course without reading and still get an A. Focus on his lectures and you'll be fine. Take notes, it makes the midterm and final way easier. Overall, good prof, not too hard, just pay attention and you'll be fine!"
8,3.5,3.0, POLISCI2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,For the online course he posts lectures online that go over and explain the readings. There are quite a few readings but weekly quizzes but they are not too difficult as long as you read. He gives you the essays for the exams before hand so its really up to you to just prepare well for them. Seems like an intelligent man. 
9,3.0,4.0, POLITSCI2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"This class is awful. Very difficult for a 2000 level class. Don't take this unless you want a headache. I'll admit I don't have much competency for theory based classes, but the material is boring and SO abstract. The final is also 45% of the overall grade and cumulative. Maybe take this course in person instead of online."
10,3.0,4.0, POLITSC2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"Professor Neblo is a good professor and makes otherwise bland topics interesting. With that said, he does not necessarily make it easy to do well. I did all the readings, watched the lectures, and took notes, and the quizzes were still very difficult. He does provide opportunities for extra credit though."
11,5.0,3.0, POLSC210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"Prof Neblo is a lighthearted, happy guy. He is a brilliant man and genuinely interested in his work. He is always glad to help students and is very approachable. He explains topics pretty well. The readings are tough but his lectures are where you learn the most. Pop quizzes were pretty hard, and the partial open note tests were decently hard"
12,4.0,2.0, POLIS210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"Professor Neblo was amazing. He genuinely cared about the subject and was able to pass that on to his students. There was a lot of reading to keep up with, but the readings were interesting. Neblo would go on tangents, but they were always relevant to the readings and helped to expand our understanding of them."
13,4.5,2.0, POLSC210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"Easily the best professor I've ever had. Nice, incredibly intelligent professor who genuinely cares about his students and wants them to learn and succeed. Be aware that it is a political Theory course, so it's going to be rooted in the readings, and the readings won't be as easy as textbook readings."
14,2.0,4.0, POLSC210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"Goes off on tangents, class has a ton of reading and most of the time you don't get the main points because he doesn't explain things well.  Very smart guy, who is not that great of a teacher"
15,4.5,5.0, PS571,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"He is one of the most likable, intelligent, and knowledgeable professors that I have had.  Take his class, go to his office hours, put a lot of work into your paper, and you will get a lot out of the class.  The quizzes will screw you because they're impossible, but do well on the paper and you'll do well in the class."
16,5.0,3.0, PS208,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"Interesting and engaged.  Always willing to help.  I took this class in the spring of 2004, but actually signed on just to make sure his rating was as high as he deserved.  Great professor...Great person."
17,4.0,4.0, POLIT210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"Neblo was a terrific professor. He explained concepts very clearly and in-depth. I learned a lot from this course and found it to be very intellectually stimulating--so much that I chose to be a political theory minor. The discussions were good and the midterms were very fair. The quizzes were a bit challenging, but if you study, you will be fine."
18,2.0,3.0, POLSC210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"He was helpful if you went to office hours. There was no book required for the class. The exams were partially open note. Almost every class, he does not tell you what he wants you to know. He just lets the conversation go where it may. Some of the really difficult readings you may not pick up on the main points unless he gives you a pop quiz."
19,4.0,3.0, PSH59604,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,NEBLO,"Professor Neblo is obviously passionate about his field and is eager to express his passion to students.  Sometimes forgets that students don't know his books as well as he does, but offers opportunities for comments and suggestions which is awesome.  If you like a little philosophy and literature in your poli sci take this class :)"
