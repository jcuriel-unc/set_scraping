1,3.0,3.0, ANTH217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"This is a bio anth class that is very manageable for people who don't get science lol. The tests can be a little difficult & the assignments a bit tedious, but otherwise an ok class. If you don't actually SEE/HEAR the lecture, you're going to miss a lot. Prof. Thompson is very considerate and caring though, she's not trying to make the class hard."
2,4.0,3.0, ANTH318,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"This was my second time taking her and I find the whole content to be interesting in whole. The downside is that she can go through lectures real quick and exams take longer than expected, but in the end, everything is open note. Maymester was a challenge, so I would recommend taking at a regular semester. Overall the content alone was interesting."
3,4.0,3.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"This class could have been more interesting than it was in my opinion. However, Dr. Thompson is really nice and understanding. There is a group project that is simple and headache free. Take the course!"
4,3.0,2.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"Dr. Thompson and the TAs for this class are super nice, but I wish we had deeper discussions about issues in lectures/recitations. This class has a lot of biology and not as much anthropology as I anticipated, and the level of complexity (from the discussion in class to the group projects assignments) kinda reminded me of high school"
5,3.0,3.0, ANTH190,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"A really nice professor. Exams were critically graded, so it is important that you do the readings. Lectures were interesting, though I felt the delivery was a bit boring."
6,3.0,4.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"Thompson is very knowledgeable but feel like she often had trouble connecting with students in a way that helped us to learn. As much as I wanted to be interested in the class, lectures were mostly just her rambling. Most of the grades were subjective and was largely determined by the TA you had. I liked the class and would take it again but ehh."
7,3.0,4.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"I really enjoyed Professor Thompson's lectures; they were very detailed and thought-provoking. However, I did pretty badly on both the midterm and the final even though I studied a lot and focused on the review guide. I would say her tests are harshly graded for sure and I never fully understood why I got points off."
8,4.0,4.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"Dr. Thompson is absolutely brilliant. Her lectures were always engaging, clear, and purposeful. I will say that grading criteria was really unclear at times. This is definitely not her fault, but the class is enormous, which can make discussions difficult."
9,4.0,3.0, ANT319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"Prof. Thompson was kind and engaging, and I enjoyed her class. She assigned weekly readings, though her lecture slides alone sufficed. We worked on 3 case studies, a course project, a midterm, and a final. Tips: Always ask TA's for context on any assignment, because they grade differently, and study hard for the midterm - many take it for granted."
10,4.0,2.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,Great lecturer and really cares about the subject material. The group project is 40% of whole grade .
11,2.0,2.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"Dr. Thompson is an incredibly mediocre professor at best. She honestly just reads from the slides and offers little chance for participation. Most people in class don't pay attention. The case studies assigned are patronizingly trivial, yet the TA's have the gall to grade all assignments and tests very harshly. Easy A, but you won't learn much."
12,5.0,2.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,Dr. Thompson is one of my favorite professors at UNC. Her lectures were always engaging and inspiring. Going to lecture/recitation is important due to lots of group work. I found myself looking forward to this class and appreciated how the course content flowed. Fair grading and expectations were always clearly laid out. Would definitely recommend!
13,1.0,3.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,Amanda is a utterly horrible human being. Grades are determined by TA's and they grade hard on exams for no reason. When you ask why points are taken off Amanda can't explain why and becomes snippy. You have to keep the same group for both projects which can be unfortunate. Grades are also not returned in a timely manner.
14,2.0,4.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"Dont bs this class. You may take it for an easy credit, but if you get a bad group for the project it can be a determining factor in final grading. Reading is not necessary. Just study all the slides and have a study group 2 days before the exam and you should be good. Also the TAs grade a lot harder than necessary, but it works out."
15,4.0,2.0, ANTH471,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"She is very knowledgeable and tends to lecture very fast, so taking notes can be a struggle. Class consisted of case study papers, student presentation and discussions, and a final, independent group research paper. As long as you read the articles, participate, and can write well, an A should be pretty easy"
16,5.0,3.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"Dr. Thompson is an amazing teacher! ANTH 319 provides a great overview of global health issues. If you already had exposure to global health from other courses this class may not provide much new info. I had taken many public health and biological/medical anthro classes before 319, so I barely read or studied at all. Still a great class!"
17,5.0,3.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"Dr. Thompson is the most eloquent lecturer I've ever had, and she is obviously super knowledgable and passionate about the subject. Very approachable outside of class as well. 2 exams were as expected, and the recitation project is a real grade-booster. Readings not necessary to get a good grade. Not a hard class, but very interesting!"
18,5.0,3.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"Her lectures are really engaging. There were 3 case studies due this semester, but the lowest grade gets dropped. The tests were more demanding that other courses I have taken in the past. They were all short answer/essay type questions. The biggest assignment in the class is the group project that is completed in recitation sections."
19,5.0,3.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"She's such an amazing lecturer. I've heard several people say she's their favorite prof at UNC. She's very approachable and helpful after class. Group projects are easy and done in recitation. If you are interested in the topics and follow the requirements you'll do well on assignments, but tests are graded harshly. Attendance not mandatory but go."
20,4.0,3.0, ANTH319,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,AMANDA,THOMPSON,"Lectures were engaging and interesting. Learned a lot about global health and social factors. Class consisted of 2 group projects, 2 case studies, midterm and final. Projects were completed during recitation so that's a plus. Midterm and final aren't bad if you study but demanding in the time given."
