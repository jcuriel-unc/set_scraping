1,5.0,2.0, 3597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"Dr. Reanne Frank was one of the most passionate and amazing professors I had ever had. She made me discover a love for a topic I never thought was possible, demography. She encourages students to have open discussions and is ok with going off track if it means have a good in depth conversation. She is truly an amazing soul and an awesome professor!"
2,5.0,4.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,I loved Dr. Frank! She removed a lot of material that gave students trouble in the past and constantly went at a pace she felt the class was understanding. Very straightforward of what is required and a fairly easy class if you just show up and pay attention.
3,3.0,2.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"Dr. Frank's lectures were extremely long, but since it was only once a week it isn't too bad. She is always considerate of whether or not students understand the subject. The class is simple for a statistics class, and is easy if you can comprehend the material. She gives tons of extra credit, and it's composed of 4 assignments and 2 exams"
4,4.0,3.0, SOCIOL3549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,She seems to be better than the reviews before me. She really seems to try hard to explain things & she is helpful if you ask questions. The lectures are really long and boring though. There's 4 HW assignments that aren't too bad and a midterm and final. She also takes attendance and gives extra credit every class. All the grades were graded fast.
5,1.5,3.0, 3549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"Extremely boring. The information is easy to grasp, but she makes it more complicated than it needs to be. I'd highly recommend if you have to take this class, take it with a different professor. Even other professors in the Sociology department warned me of taking this class with her as a professor"
6,1.0,1.0, SOC597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"She has been here a few years, people say she is getting better. I wish she was organized (even a little bit)."
7,5.0,1.0, SOC597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"Good professor. Does not post notes on Carmen, must attend class for notes. Two easy papers to write, 3 pages at most. Studying is required, but it isn't hard material. Mostly common sense. I recommend Frank if you want an easy A."
8,5.0,3.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"Of all instructors that teach this course, Dr. Frank is among the best. She has taught the course more than five times, so basically she has a grasp on it. The best quality about her is that she wants you to succeed, so she makes the exams/assignments/policies fair and offers extra credit. She is extraordinarily bright and rents clickers for you."
9,5.0,2.0, SOC597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"Dr. Frank did a great job relating introductory demography with world pop trends/issues.Easy enough if you show up to class, pay attention and study a little bit (imagine that...)The info should be thought provoking to those interested in global demographics.I recommend this course.You're unlikely to encounter this material anywhere else, so LEARN!"
10,4.5,1.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"this class was SO easy! gives extra credit in every lecture, and attendance is mandatory. she makes the material very clear and gives many examples. i thought stats would be my hardest class but ended up with an A very easily. 4 assignments and 2 exams. i think our class had 18 extra credit points given over the quarter. take her!"
11,4.5,2.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"She made everything pretty clear. Especially when learning stats it is easy to be confused, but she explains it very well and has many examples which helps!"
12,4.5,3.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,Whoever says she is bad is wrong. Dr Frank is a really good teacher and her class is easy unless you are an idiot. She explains everything very well in class and anything you dont understand can be found in the book or you can ask and she's very helpful.
13,3.5,4.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,Very easy on the eyes
14,1.0,5.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"No one ever knew what she was talking about. When questions were asked, she only repeated herself and did not give us a good explanation"
15,3.5,3.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"A little unorganized at times, but overall not a bad professor. If anything, the TA's will prevent you from understanding the material by making things more confusing than necessary."
16,1.0,5.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"She seemed to be confused about what she was talking about at times, and she spoke in the same bored tone the entire lecture. Take a different professor!"
17,3.5,3.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REANNE,FRANK,"Dr. Frank was young, and it showed. While her class wasn't too bad, and she did a good job or giving a lot of examples, I got the vibe that her lectures were really disorganized and some of the assignments were really unclear about what she wanted on them. Not a terribly difficult class, if you have to take 549, take it with her..not bad to look at"
