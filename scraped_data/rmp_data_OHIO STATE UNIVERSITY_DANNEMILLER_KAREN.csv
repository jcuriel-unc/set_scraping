1,2.0,5.0, PUBHEHS3320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KAREN,DANNEMILLER,Class is extremely overwhelming with material. Not clear instructions given. You have to retake material until you get a 90% . So much to do for a 3320 class. Do not recommend at all
2,3.0,1.0, PUBHEHS3320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KAREN,DANNEMILLER,"She's a new professor and it shows, completely changed the class after the low average on the first midterm, but made it ridiculously easy instead. Easy to go to class and get an A without learning anything, but if you pay attention to the lectures you can learn a lot."
