1,5.0,1.0, CSE2501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MARTIN,"A really awesome lecturer and class! There's only three grades: attendance, a research paper, a PowerPoint presentation. But he doesn't take attendance, and the other two are on topics of your choice, due at the end of the semester. Even though you don't really need to go, his lectures are still super interesting and worthwhile to listen to."

3,5.0,1.0, CSE3231,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MARTIN,He is super easy. You just have some quizzes which he sends the questions out a day early so you just show up and fill it out. He has required workshops but doesn't take attendance (but can be fun). Midterm and final are easy. Basically just a pretty easy class where you learn some useful things.
