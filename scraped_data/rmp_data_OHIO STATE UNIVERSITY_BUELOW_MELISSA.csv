1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,BUELOW,Amazing is an understatement. She makes class enjoyable and makes you want to come to class. Exams are all written response but they were easier to me than my other classes as long as you study of course. She listens to her students and class is pretty straightforward. Theres easy extra credit. I took it with PSYCH3313 and it was a breeze.
2,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,BUELOW,"An absolute gem is an understatement. Very passionate about what she does and would bend over backwards to help you succeed. Passionate about the class, and even shows pictures of baby animals after tough lectures. Final was a BREEZE. Can not compare to any other class Ive taken on main campus. GOAT status"
3,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,BUELOW,"Very interesting class. Loved the lectures. Only complaint is she sometimes talks way too fast and it can become hard to take good notes. Other than that, nice professor who gives plenty of opportunities to raise your grade with extra credit since exams can be quite difficult and long."
4,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,BUELOW,"Very informative class, would definitely reccommend taking."
5,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,BUELOW,Quite helpful in preparing you for further research papers and research in general. Makes lectures interesting and fun.
6,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,BUELOW,Dr. Buelow was really great! Funny lady and was always very clear during lecture. Gotta show up though or else you probably won't do well. Easy class as well. You get to drop your lowest exam grade which was awesome.
7,3.5,3.0, PSYCH236702,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,BUELOW,She is a very nice professor and gives out lots of extra credit. Sometimes a fast talker but overall helpful.
8,5.0,3.0, PSYCH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,BUELOW,"Took 4 classes with Buelow over 3 years and she was the best Psych Prof. at Newark.  Test were not difficult, but You have to study. Extra credit really helps your grade."
9,2.0,3.0, PSYCHOLOGY,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,BUELOW,Lectures are extremely long and boring. She is a really fast talker so you miss a lot of the notes. She doesn't finish the chapter before you have to take a quiz on it. She's really good with extra credit but overall worst class I took this semester. I would recommend anothe professor! 
10,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MELISSA,BUELOW,Dr. Buelow wants the best for her students. Very helpful and understanding. One of the best Psych Professors at OSU Newark. Must attend class for assignments and possible extra credit opportunities.
