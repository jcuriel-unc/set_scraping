1,5.0,4.0, POLI472,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Professor Bickford is an amazing educator and you will realize that if you engage and put in the effort like she asks you to. She is a tough grader but there are opportunities to improve your grade via ""tokens."" She stresses attendance and you won't do well if you are absent and don't do the readings. Readings are manageable and worth your time. "
2,5.0,4.0, POLI276H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Ugh, love her! Very respectful towards students. The class is mostly a philosophy seminar (see: participation!) with lots of assigned readings & quite a bit of writing assignments. That being said, she is very flexible & considerate. The final was a self designed project so we got to be a bit creative and dive in deeper to what we wanted to learn."
3,5.0,3.0, POLI276H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"I took her POLI276H class and I will be taking as many of her classes as my schedule will allow. I love classes, but it does have a bit of reading. Amazing discussions, very respectful, and always able to talk. 10/10"
4,4.0,4.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"If you don't have experience with political philosophy this class will not be easy. Dr. Bickford is a tough grader, but she gives a lot of feedback. She is a very kind and approachable person and is genuinely passionate about teaching."
5,1.0,3.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Embodies everything I used to hate about English classes in HS, encourages individual interpretation but says your interpretation is wrong. Only gives decent grades to those that think like her. Lowest paper grade at UNC was a 92 before this class, yet she said my writing quality concerned her that I had a learning disability."
6,5.0,4.0, POLI472,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Professor Bickford clearly cares about the material quite a bit, and you can tell that it's important to her that she doesn't just tell you about it, but that you learn it. She also gives very informative feedback on the papers, all of which are very short besides the final. Highly recommend!"
7,5.0,4.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"By far the best professor I've had at Carolina. She is engaging and really cares about her students. The readings are tough, and she's a hard grader but if you're willing to work for it this class is a must!"
8,5.0,4.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Professor Bickford is one of the most genuine Professors at UNC. She truly cares about her students and strives to treat everyone with respect. I'm not going to lie- she's a tough grader, but she gives awesome feedback and will most definitely help you to become a better writer. This class reading and writing heavy."
9,1.0,3.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"The content itself is interesting and so is class discussion, but the grading process is convoluted. It is extremely different to improve grades on writing assignments because the process it nit-picky and no rubric is given. Little feedback given and she doesn't specify where you lose points. Take a different political thought class for poli major."
10,5.0,4.0, POLI472,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Dr. Bickford is one of the most brilliant and kindest people you'll meet. She's not just a good professor, but a phenomenal teacher as well. I appreciate her dedication to class. Her courses are well-organized and cover a good variety of topics. The type of writing she expects is likely different from what you're used to. A's are uncommon."
11,4.0,4.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Dr. Bickford is a great professor in that she's incredibly knowledgeable and cares about the subject and her students. In this class, you have to read a lot for each period and write papers often. She's definitely a tough paper grader and you do have to talk a lot consistently to get a decent participation grade. Not an easy A, but rewarding."
12,5.0,4.0, POLI472,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Professor Bickford is a wonderful teacher and facilitator in class. Get ready to read--a lot! Some familiarity with reading philosophy papers will help you a lot in this class. She really cares about you as both a student and a human being, and is so helpful in and out of class! Highly recommend taking this class, even though an A is unlikely."
13,5.0,4.0, POLI276H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Professor Bickford is incredible!!! Definitely one of the tougher graders at UNC, but I have learned so much from her class! Readings are a lot and often v dense, but if you genuinely want to learn and improve as a student, you should take a course form her! Also so willing to help students if they need it!"
14,5.0,4.0, POLI472,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Professor Bickford is amazing! A tough grader, but genuinely wants to help improve your writing and critical thinking. I have improved as a writer from taking this course. Lots of reading, very discussion based and small group work. Lots of writing but all of the material is incredibly interesting and she does an amazing job leading discussions!"
15,5.0,4.0, POLI472,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"The material is super interesting and Professor Bickford clearly cares about it. Classes are structured around participation, which makes it all extremely engaging and enjoyable. Professor Bickford is helpful and very supportive."
16,2.0,5.0, POLI265,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"She is a harsh grader- does not like giving out anything higher than a B-. It should be a good discussion based class, but she makes it so difficult that no one ends up learning because they're so worried about their grades."
17,4.0,4.0, POLI265,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"She is an AWESOME professor. However, she runs the class almost like a graduate seminar- there is an incredible amount of reading, and you have to print out everything. For our class, this was about 400 pages per person. RIP to my CCI Printing money. She is a tough grader, almost unneccessarily so, but she cares about how you do in the class."
18,5.0,4.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Excellent class. It's not an easy course for anyone just to slack and get a good grade, but if you work for it, it's surely worth it. Professor is super helpful, friendly, and inspiring. Class discussion is always in a great atmosphere. professor smiles when you talk to her, and she gets so excited when someone come up with good thoughts!"
19,5.0,4.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Professor Bickford is a great professor. The first year seminar I took with her is one of my favorite courses I have ever taken at UNC. If you're taking it because you expect an easy A, you probably won't get it. But the class discussions are incredibly interesting, and you will improve your writing and analytical thinking skills."
20,5.0,3.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUSAN,BICKFORD,"Great prof!  Really let's everybody tell what they think about the questions at hand.  Also, she's very serious about participation so don't think that you can join her class and not talk or do the readings, which can get dull at times.  However, the great discussions make it all worth it."
