1,4.0,4.0, POLI57,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,HARTLYN,"Prof. Hartlyn is a top dog when it comes to Latin American Political Science. This class is personalized for first-years, making it accessible and educational. Sometimes the lectures seem a little dense, but if you take this class, you will emerge with a good understanding of history, politics, and culture in Latin America."
2,5.0,4.0, POLI435,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,HARTLYN,"Dr. Hartlyn's class covers a lot of material, but he goes above and beyond to make himself available if you need extra help at any time and he is super kind. It is not an easy A- there are 2 exams, 10 pg paper, and group presentation which count for a lot of your grade, but the material is interesting particularly if you are studying Latin America."
3,2.0,4.0, POLI435,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,HARTLYN,"He really knew what he was talking about and was enthusiastic about the subject, but really painful to watch speak for over an hour. I ended up taking no notes and not learning much."
4,3.0,4.0, POLI435,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,HARTLYN,"Definitely think this class is better in person not online. Prof. was accommodating for me & seems to really care for us. But, there is a lot of info in this class & presented on not really organized slides. I would take this class again in person, but not online. Wait it out for in person classes imo. There is also a group project & final paper."
5,3.0,4.0, POLI435,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,HARTLYN,"BEWARE: Don't take this online. Quizzes, assignments assigned mid-week due 5pm Friday (sometimes in groups), group work (powerpoint), news reports. Hard exams (so much material is covered), lots of readings. Prof gave little accommodation; I suspect essay ext. was because of huge demand. Wait out COVID-19; you'll learn more, hate this class less."
6,5.0,4.0, POLI435,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,HARTLYN,"Dr. Hartlyn is incredibly knowledgeable. It is clear that he really knows his stuff. The class is super interesting and I really learned a lot. You can't just breeze by in this class, you will have to put in the effort to do well, but Prof. Hartlyn really cares about his students and wants to see you succeed."
7,5.0,4.0, POLI435,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,HARTLYN,"It is the class that you have to take if you want to learn about Latin America. Dr Hartlyn is great man and professor, always support me outside of class in my research and give very useful feedback."
8,5.0,3.0, POLI57,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,HARTLYN,"I went to Professor Hartlyn for help on a paper on Colombia this semester and I'm not even currently in his class. He has written and experienced so much on Latin America his input is invaluable, he hooked me up with all kinds of people, books, and articles in about 30 minutes. He (and profs like him) are the reason UNC is worth attending."
9,3.0,4.0, POLI57,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,HARTLYN,"He's a good teacher, but DON'T TAKE HIS FYS. He teaches what are meant to be easy classes as if they're 400-level courses (what he's used to teaching). There's a term paper, group project, readings, midterms, and a final. He's a great guy, but this is not an easy-A. If you're interested in the subject and don't mind the hard work, then go ahead."
