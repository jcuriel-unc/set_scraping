1,4.0,1.0, NSCI222H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TODD,THIELE,"Dr. Thiele values straightforward exam/quiz questions, so do not worry about him trying to trick you. Grading criteria is extremely clear, and the slides contain everything you need to know. Go to class so you can ask questions - he checks in frequently to see if students have any confusion. "
2,4.0,4.0, NSCI222,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TODD,THIELE,"Professor Thiele is great. While his lectures may not be the most interesting, he more than makes up for it in communication and exams. They were never unfair, generally were questions that you'd know how to answer if you were in lecture, and were very time-forgiving. If you're in neuroscience, he's one of the best professors you could have."
3,4.0,3.0, NROC25,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TODD,THIELE,I just want to point out that the there is another Dr. Tod Thiele at the University of Toronto who also teaches neuroscience and I find that hilarious.
4,5.0,3.0, NSCI222H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TODD,THIELE,"Class is pretty straightforward and as long as you do the assigned readings and show up to class you'll be successful. Tests are legit just what's on the PowerPoint slides so if you study those before exams you'll be alright. Chill guy and cares about what he does, and is happy to answer any questions. I really enjoyed his class."
5,5.0,1.0, PSYC222H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TODD,THIELE,"Awesome professor, 11/10 recommend."
6,5.0,2.0, PSYC222H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TODD,THIELE,"Dr. Thiele explained all concepts clearly and was always willing to answer questions. He undoubtably understands that learning a great deal can be accomplished without making the class difficult, and never tested on trick questions. He often incorporated real life examples so students could better understand and apply the concepts. Extremely kind"
7,4.0,3.0, PSYC222H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TODD,THIELE,"Great guy. Could get a little boring because of repeated topics and constant lectures, but in the end everything he talks about ends up being on the test so it's worth it. Three big exams and one journal, lots of mini quizzes. Easy A if you show up to class and study notes the night before test."
8,5.0,3.0, PSYC222,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TODD,THIELE,"Nice person and good professor who is very passionate about his work and incorporates that into his lectures. Tests are mostly from his slides, not the book, so if you go to class and study the slides, you should do well on tests. Lectures can get a little tiring after a while because of the material being covered, but a nice, easy class overall."
9,5.0,1.0, PSYC222H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TODD,THIELE,"Phenomenal professor! Lectures could tend to get dry, but his uses his research to teach and made it interesting.  He pulls tests directly from slide material, super straightforward.  You have to show up to class, but other than that, it's an easy A"
10,4.0,3.0, PSYC222H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TODD,THIELE,"I didn't have any problems with him. Lecture attendance is definitely required: all tests are based on the slides from the lecture. The class itself wasn't too boring, and he was very clear about grading. Each assignment took some work but not any more than any other class. We had one bigger project, but had all semester to do it. A good prof"
