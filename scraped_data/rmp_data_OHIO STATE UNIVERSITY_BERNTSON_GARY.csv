1,4.0,1.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"Not a very engaging professor, but the class is easy. Powerpoints are straight from the book and tests are straight froom the powerpoints..do not buy book! You can find it at the library reserves. Only 3 tests, with the lowest dropped. Grades are curved at the end..interesting material!"
2,4.0,3.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"A very good professor - I really enjoyed attending his lectures. He's extremely knowledgeable on this subject and is genuinely interested in teaching. Awesome prof, awesome class!"
3,1.0,5.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,Terrible terrible terrible terrible professor!!!! I can't even explain how much I hated his class. I am very interested in this topic and he made me hate it. Sitting through his classes is the worst experience ever. He speaks incredibly slowly and in a monotone voice and does absolutely nothing for his students. Never goes over tests. AVOID!!!!!!!!
4,3.5,4.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"The material is tough, but if you pay CLOSE attention during lecture you should do okay. I'm into this topic so it was probably a bit more interesting for me. He's kind of witty, explains things pretty well for such a complex topic."
5,3.5,3.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"There was a lot of talk about neurotransmitters and whatnot, which I wasn't prepared for and his monotone voice made lectures kind of painful to sit through; however,if you study the powerpoints he posts on carmen, you will do well in the class. Also, if you do well on the first two exams, you are done for the quarter!"
6,5.0,2.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"very interesting, lot of material, grades are curved"
7,4.0,3.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,Great class--great prof
8,3.0,4.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"Definitely a lot harder then it seems. A lot of memorizing technical drug names and history of drug use. Tricky test questions and a TON of material to learn. Does not give +/- only A,B,C,D. Test averages in my class were low 70%. It's also really hard to listen to his voice during class and he goes really quick through the slides. AVOID!!"
9,4.5,3.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"This class should be named Into to Neuropharmacology. Avoid if you are dumb about Psychiatry and drugs. You'll be memorizing pill names and what receptors they hit. I got a B by looking at the powerpoints the night before.  that's only because of my previous intrest in crazy meds. Tough class for most, although heavily curved."
10,5.0,5.0, PSY305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,Best class ever.
11,5.0,5.0, PSY305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"Great professor, got me interested in this topic and now I'm going to graduate school!"
12,5.0,5.0, PSY305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,Totally awesome class.  Best professor I ever had.
13,3.0,3.0, PSY305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,This class should be taught online. There is no reason to go to class. All he does is read directly from the slides. His exams are hard... but his curve in the end is nice. Lectures are VERY boring!
14,3.0,4.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,Interesting material. DO NOT BUY BOOK!! You will never open it. His powerpoints come straight from book and test question come straight from powerpoints. Class becomes a bit boring after awhile. Best 2 out of 3 on your test grades.  Failry hard class. I still recommend it.
15,3.0,2.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"He LITERALLY reads right from the powerpoint slides, so if it's in outline form, don't expect him to make clear sentences and explain further then what is stated on the slide. slides posted online, study from those. grade is based off 2 out of 3 tests. You drop your lowest test. easy if you study the slides that he tells you to for the tests."
16,3.0,4.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"Another class where the only grades are a 50% midterm and a 50% final. I hate that. I don't think there was any curve so if you moderately screw one up, well, you are kinda just screwed in general. He seems like a nice guy but after a week you will probably get bored of his lectures and just stop going. Just download/study from the powerpoints."
17,3.5,2.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"He wasn't the most well organized prof, but lectures are interesting and he fosters discussion very well.  Tests were difficult, if you didn't study.  He is very willing to help, but you have to ask for it first!  Just because you didn't study and didn't get an A doesn't make it a bad class or him a bad prof."
18,1.5,3.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,So disappointed. He is so unclear and the tests are hard!
19,2.5,4.0, PSYCH305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,BERNTSON,"Watch out for this guy. He only does 2 grades - a midterm and final - but they're so hard! The class was called psychology of drugs and behavior, yet I have not seen any behavior aspects yet."
