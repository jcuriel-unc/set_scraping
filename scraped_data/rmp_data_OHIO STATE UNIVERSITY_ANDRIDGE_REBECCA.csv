The organization of the courses is fantastic. It does involve a good amount of work, but I never felt it was a waste of time or busy work. She makes me regret not choosing epidemiology or biostats as my focus for grad school."
2,5.0,3.0, PUBHLTH6001,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REBECCA,ANDRIDGE,"My favorite professor to learn from in 6 years at Ohio State (undergrad + grad school). Her lectures are so clear, her organization is unbeatable, and I genuinely came away from this class feeling confident in everything she taught me. Makes me regret not doing epidemiology. There is a lot of work with the course, but nothing you don't learn from."
3,5.0,3.0, PUBHLTH6001,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REBECCA,ANDRIDGE,My experience with Dr.Andridge was very positive. I really appreciate how she teaches (you do a weekly lab and quizzes and assignments ) so you get plenty of practice before exams. She will also take time to explain concepts and make sure that you understand it by the end of her explanation. I would highly recommend taking any course with her. 
4,1.0,4.0, PUBHLTH6001,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,REBECCA,ANDRIDGE,Dr. Andridge is a very difficult professor to work with and does not respect her students. When difficult situations arise in the classroom she's been shown to handle them extremely unfairly and without respect and careful consideration. If you're looking for fair treatment and respect from your professor I would not recommend Dr. Andridge.
