1,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"I loved Poli 150 even as a Media and Journalism major! The class has few grades so study hard for the midterm and final! This was a super chill class that was really straightforward. I'd recommend it to anyone, I never did the lecture readings and still got an A- in the class. Also, both the TAs and the professor were accessible outside of class. "
2,5.0,3.0, POLI440,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"I've taken 2 classes with CBR, he's the best! 2 papers and 2 exams, is a fair grader, and is approachable. His study guides really prepare you for exams. His writing prompts are thought-provoking and something you can easily talk about if you've paid attention in class. "
3,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"Professor Ballard-Rosa was an excellent professor for an introductory IR and economics course. Despite his expertise in highly complicated domains, he prioritizes simple and straightforward explanations of course material. The course grade consisted of two papers, a midterm, a final, participation/attendance (within recitation)."
4,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"Professor Ballard-Rosa gave great lectures that made the course material digestible as well as engaging. I did get lucky with a great recitation leader as well, so my experience might be better than others. There are only 4 assignments total: 1 midterm, 2 essays, and the final. He posts all his lecture slides and Zoom recordings if you miss class."
5,4.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"I found the lectures to be fairly engaging and even funny at some points. My only complaint is that there are only two assignments, outside of tests (a midterm and final), so you have to do really well on these to do well in the class. I would have personally preferred more smaller assignments through the semester."
6,5.0,3.0, POLI442,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"Professor Ballard-Rosa is the best professor I have had at UNC. His lectures are incredibly engaging, often funny, and always interesting. I've taken him for poli 150, 442, and am taking him next semester for 440. He is a special professor. 100% take his course if you can. "
7,5.0,4.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"Professor Ballard-Rosa is incredible. He knows what he is talking about and really helps you understand the subject. I found his tests to be a bit unfair, not testing you on everything you know, however, the TA for my class was pretty awful, probably relating to the hard grading. His lectures are great and class is interesting, just get a good TA!!"
8,5.0,3.0, POLI442,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"Extremely skilled at lecturing, presents advanced ideas and research in very understandable terms. Would absolutely take again. Fair warning, the papers are complex."
9,3.0,2.0, POLI442,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"This was a good class overall. Only two assignments, a mid-term, and final. Only thing I wish was different was his lecture style because sometimes he would quickly cover more difficult topics and others were very repetitive."
10,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"I LOVED this class. It was well structured, and Ballard-Rosa is a great presenter. The course had 2 major papers and 2 exams, but he was clear on all requirements. He was also very understanding with deadlines if negative events occurred on campus. Take a class with him."
11,5.0,3.0, POLI442,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"Professor Ballard-Rosa is easily one of the best professors I have had at UNC. His lectures are incredibly relevant to the modern day and I learned an immense amount. He is constantly available outside of class and is extremely accommodating, no matter the situation. I would 100% recommend you take his upper level smaller classes (like 442)."
12,5.0,4.0, POLI442,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"CBR is a great prof for my upper lvl POLI class. There are much readings/dense and he gives AWESOME lectures and FEEDBACK on PS/Exams. He is funny and genuinely passionate about IPE and is vocal/ENGAGING. I will definitely take class with him! I did not do too good on my 1st PS, but could have got a A, so close. But massive respect to him! HARD PS!"
13,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"CBR is a great professor. Although it is lecture heavy, he makes them really engaging. He is also very caring, and was very willing to work with students who were struggling. Your grade consists of 2 five page papers (Graded by TA), a mid-term, a final, and participation/attendance in recitations depending on your TA."
14,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"CBR is a wonderful professor. It's a powerpoint lecture class, but that's to be expected with an entry poli sci course. Made the material interesting and humorous. Would not hesitate to take again."
15,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"CBR is an excellent lecturer, and his lectures are thorough enough that you can go light on the readings. Although your grade is largely dependent on your TA, I felt the class was a pretty easy A. CBR's tests are straight forward and really not designed to trick you."
16,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"CBR was amazing! He gives great lectures and explains concepts in a way that anyone can understand. There are only two graded assignments apart from the midterm and final, so it can be difficult to recover if you mess up on one. CBR makes understanding everything so easy and fun, though, that you won't have to worry. Would definitely recommend him!"
17,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"CBR was awesome. Super caring and understanding of his students the whole semester. On top of that, he communicated the material really well and made the more mundane topics interesting. Only complaint is that there's only 2 papers and 2 tests, so if you slip up on one it's tricky to recover. Other than that, could not recommend this guy enough!"
18,5.0,3.0, POLI442,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"Honestly one of the best professors I've ever had. He's an Incredible and hilarious lecturer. He makes class enjoyable and the material easy to understand. Readings can be hard, but he explains everything in class, so it's okay even if you don't do them. Problem sets can be tricky, but he's super open to talking through them with you if you ask."
19,4.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,"He just loves teaching and is so good at it. However, his presentations were just reiterating the text book, so I stopped reading, but still getting an A or high B right now. 2 1500 word papers, midterm, final, and recitation attendance are all he grades."
20,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CAMERON,BALLARD-ROSA,CBR is one of the best lecturers I had here at UNC. I enjoyed how into the subject he was and how he was one of the only professors I had that cared for the mental wellbeing of all his students. Would 100 percent recommend to anyone who is considering a class of his
