1,4.0,4.0, SOCI469,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"I really liked Dr. Hargrove and I enjoyed the lectures a lot. I thought the content was super interesting. However, I was not prepared for the difficulty level; I did poorly on the exams despite how hard I would study, and I found the final project to be really difficult. There's 2 midterms and a final exam as well as a final group project"
2,4.0,2.0, SOCI469,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"Professor Hargrove is a super sweet lady. Lessons were very discussion based, it is important to take notes on what she says more than the slides. You do a group project for most of the semester which sucks if you have a bad group. Tests weren't too bad 15mc, 2 short ended, and an essay normally. TA does all the grading but ours was super nice."
3,5.0,2.0, SOCI469,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"I LOVE professor Hargrove and I don't understand why she has such low ratings. The class is literally so easy as long as you show up, you don't even really need to do the readings for the class to do well. She is sweet, so accommodating, understanding, and tries her hardest to make class interesting. "
4,5.0,3.0, SOCI469,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"Definitely a good amount of reading but Professor Hargrove made this class one of my all time favorites at UNC. Her lectures were interesting, informative, and she is incredibly inclusive. We talked about important topics but Professor Hargrove made everyone feel safe to share opinions or have their voice heard. 10/10 professor."
5,3.0,3.0, SOCI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"This class is harder than a typical soci class (still not hard) and Hargrove takes such interesting material and makes it boring. All you do is read papers and write (forum posts, reading memos, semester long paper) and you don't really feel like you learned anything. She is nice and caring, I just think she could revamp the structure of the class"
6,4.0,3.0, SOCI469,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"I have Hargrove for 422 & 469. She's very reasonable. I like that she makes an effort to learn everyone's name. Both classes have a semester-long project that she chunks up into mini assignments. Lectures aren't bad bc she breaks it up w/ discussion, videos, and activities. Tests for 469 are hard for a SOCI class, but fine if you just study"
7,1.0,4.0, SOCI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"there's a reason why Hargrove has so many bad reviews. she doesn't know how to teach. she reads off lecture slides and forces students to participate. the content of the course is extremely boring and outdated. you can tell she's had little to no pedagogical training. avoid taking her at all costs. not a fair grader at all, and i made an A."
8,2.0,3.0, SOCI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,Exams aren't hard if you go to class. Readings are outdated and dull. Lectures are boring and she calls on people if she doesn't get enough participation which is annoying. Little to no feedback on any of the assignments except for the midterm. For a class about mental health she didn't really seem to care about ours
9,3.0,3.0, SOCI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"Hargrove has a lot of awful reviews. Her lecture isn't entirely productive & you do have to be in class most of the time, but the material is common sense. She's a bit dry, along with the material. But don't be scared of this class. Her tests are fair, and I got by without reading except to clarify. It's not as awful as her reviews make it seem."
10,1.0,3.0, SOCI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"I wanted a fairly easy class, but hargrove does not make it easy to get an A. She gives next to 0 feedback and isn't helpful during office hours. I had a tragic family event happen this semester and she was not understanding at all. Unless you are a 2nd semester senior and this is a mandatory class, don't take it with her! !"
11,5.0,3.0, SOCI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"I really enjoyed Dr. Hargrove's class! The lecture material was interesting and I felt I learned a lot in her class environment. I particularly enjoyed the panel about mental health in the criminal justice system. Also, we watched Silver Linings Playbook in class which was a nice break during a hard week (Bradley Cooper also helped) She cares a lot"
12,5.0,4.0, SOCI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"Love Dr. Hargrove -- one of the most well-spoken and inspirational profs i have had at UNC. Doesn't give much feedback on assignments but isn't a particularly hard grader. Assignments are a midterm, four 2-3 page reading responses, and a big term paper split into a bunch of different parts. highly recommend if you're interested in psychology"
13,3.0,2.0, SOCI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"she was alright - the class was more boring than i anticipated but it was easy. i got away with not doing the readings until skimming them the night before the exam. she's not clear about what's on her exams (she says ""it's all important""), but they're mostly based off her powerpoint slides which she posts online. fine for a gen ed, but boring"
14,1.0,3.0, SOCI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"made what should have been such an interesting class so awful and boring. did not care about students learning the material or valuing their additions to discussion. no feedback on any assignments throughout the semester besides ""met the requirements."" tough grader without much feedback or leeway"
15,1.0,4.0, SOCI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"I felt that Dr. Hargrove didn't really care about her students, whether or not they learned the material, or teaching the course. She was really unfriendly and lectured right off the slides despite assigning tons of reading. This class should have been really interesting, but she made it incredibly boring."
16,2.0,3.0, SOCI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TAYLOR,HARGROVE,"Dr. Hargrove is nice but she could make the class a lot more interesting and engaging. Heavy readings which don't really matter, so just don't waste your time. Exams will come from lectures. Annoying final project. Overall not a stressful class but not an ""easy A"""
