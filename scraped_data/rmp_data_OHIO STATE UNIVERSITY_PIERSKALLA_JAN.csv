Lectures were solid and slideshow heavy, still interesting though. Encouraged participation. Final paper was very long/tough but very fairly graded with good feedback. Midterm and Final were good. Only take the class if you truly care about the content."
2,3.0,3.0, POLITSCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAN,PIERSKALLA,I like him as a person this class was just so boring to me so i stopped going. i only went to the midterm review. slides are online and quizzes are open note. lots of readings. Hes a great guy though
3,5.0,2.0, INTSTDS3850,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAN,PIERSKALLA,"Great teacher! Easy to contact either through office hours or emails, which he usually responds to extremely fast. Answers questions without making the students feel belittled or dumb, and he makes it very clear what he expects you to know for any exams."
4,4.0,2.0, POLITSCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAN,PIERSKALLA,Attendance is not mandatory and he lectures straight off his slides which he puts online. He gives you the test questions before the midterms so as long as you outline/study those you are good to go. There are weekly online reading quizzes and make sure you get 100% on those because they will carry your grade. Country memo at the end
5,5.0,2.0, POLITSCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAN,PIERSKALLA,"Great prof. Gives test questions beforehand, and a country memo essay at the end. Attendance isn't taken either. Great guy too and is funny."
6,4.0,2.0, POLITSCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAN,PIERSKALLA,"This was a pretty easy class overall. Dr. Pierskalla is a great guy who makes the exams so easy. Literally just memorizing answers to practice short answer problems, then he picks a few and makes them the test. The final paper is a bit trickier and denser, but if you go talk to him about it he's willing to work with you. I would really recommend"
7,4.5,2.0, POLITSCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAN,PIERSKALLA,"He was super awesome.  He truly wanted to help us learn and gave us access to all the lectures.  Study the powerpoints, learn some vocab, and apply it to the essays. Super easy, cut and dry."
8,4.5,3.0, 3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAN,PIERSKALLA,"I took the Politics of the Developing World with Dr Pierskalla and was not disappointed. He was committed to communicating the material well and I learned a lot. Lectures were sometimes dry, but if the course is interesting to you that's not going to be a big problem.  Exams were straightforward and a list of essays were provided as a study guide"
