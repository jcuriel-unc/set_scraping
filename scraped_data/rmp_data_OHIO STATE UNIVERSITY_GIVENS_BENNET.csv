1,3.0,5.0, PSYCH3313H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"Givens shouldn't be teaching an intro neuroscience class. Seems like his lectures are aimed more towards grad students. 3 exams are worth almost all of your grade and require an insane amount of studying. Questions on exams come from a topic he mentioned once or twice in a lecture. Nice guy and really helpful, he's just teaching the wrong class."
2,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3313H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"I think Dr. Givens really cares about what he teaches, but I feel as though he didn't do a very good job of teaching the material. Instead of what he used to do, there are three exams and very few other assignments. The exams themselves are quite difficult and require a lot of memorization and dedication to get down. However, this is neuroscience."
3,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3313H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"Dr. B was a great prof, esp during the pandemic. He was accommodating. For the online class, there's no final. Just a quiz every alt week, and very basic homework assignments. He was always v helpful and accessible. Attendance isn't mandatory, but it's harder to get an A if you don't pay attention. Gives hints about questions before quizzes."
4,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3313H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"2 midterms, 1 final, 1 group presentation, 1 unofficial presentation and 1 short essay. The grading is clear. No text book use. The course materials were complicated and there were a bunch of things to remember, but Bennet was always willing to help you with that. Participation is not required, but it was hard to get high grade without attending."
5,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3313H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"He was super nice and caring, and always accessible outside of class. He often gave us hints for potential exam questions, which was very helpful. 2 midterms and a final, with multiple choice and choice of short answer. I found his lectures to be pretty engaging and he was happy to answer questions as class went along. I would take his class again!"
6,4.0,3.0, PSYCH5614,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"While Dr. Givens can be quiet and scatter-brained, he is such a nice guy. He validated all the concerns I had on my presentation and research articles. This course was mostly discussion based, so it was mostly students presenting. You'll be bored a lot, it can be time consuming for essay exams that you write in advance, but its not too stressful."
7,4.0,3.0, 3313H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"The class have a lot of memorization. However, the exams are straightforward and have extra credit. Print slides before class and/or add notes from his lecture to the slides. He only focuses on important points and some exam questions are from his lecture (not on slides). He didn't really agree with textbook sometimes. One presentation assignment."
8,4.0,4.0, PSYCH3313H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"Dr. Givens is a great professor who genuinely cares about the material and helping students learn more.  The class is pretty tough, and I would recommend it only if you're a psych/neuroscience major; as I'm only a psych minor (business major) it was actually the hardest class I've taken at OSU."
9,3.5,3.0, PSY313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,Not too difficult but not too easy. 3 hr long lecture was boring but overall not bad. Never touched textbook...
10,3.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,Was a little...okay very monotone and the lectures were a bit of a bore but all the info you needr is on the power points and his jeopardy games help a lot. Overall a decent teacher.
11,3.0,1.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"Easy, lecture wasn't necessary as he basically read right off slides, but exams are online and you have ample time"
12,2.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"Talks so quiet! Class is boring but not terrible, 3 online exams and 2 assignments. Sounds easy, but he expects extreme detail in answers so if it isn't perfect you will miss points. Zero curve and only 200 points so hard to get better than an A- in my opinion. Frustrating but not too bad if you are familiar with neuroscience."
13,5.0,1.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,He was an Amazing teacher; very informative and the class was a breeze (very easy)
14,4.0,2.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"Class was relatively easy. Lectures are somewhat boring, but his PowerPoints are incredibly useful. The exams come straight from them. Make sure you pay attention in class because there will be exam questions that cover material that he vocalizes."
15,3.5,4.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"Lectures are long and boring. He claims his test material comes out of the slides, but I found the book way more helpful. Tests are very difficult, but he curves them, which helps a lot. Difficult, but technically do-able class. On an unrelated note: he's kinda hot in a bizarre way"
16,3.0,3.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,Very boring lectures. I found myself learning more from the textbook than the lectures. Tests were moderate.. not impossible though.
17,2.5,5.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"He seemed very friendly/eager to help students, but he was a terrible lecturer. He was very vague about a lot of his slides and generally seemed uninterested in most of the material. Tests were very difficult."
18,4.5,2.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"Super friendly and helpful. Lectures could get dry, but the material is really interesting.  He tries to stick to what you need to know, but will also go more in depth if people ask.  You can really see his passion for the field even though he is a bit monotone."
19,3.0,4.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"Super nice guy, crazy-making quiet/scattered lecturer. If you don't know much about neuroscience you'll have to teach yourself from the book (what I did) or spend lots of time with him one-on-one. He's probably much better for advanced students."
20,3.0,5.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENNET,GIVENS,"This professor is very boring. It is very tempting to just skip class and teach yourself from the book.  He is helpful one on one because you can constantly ask questions.  For such a boring class, it didn't help that he didn't provide any way of making it interesting.  This class is required for my major and I might have to retake it, yikes!"
