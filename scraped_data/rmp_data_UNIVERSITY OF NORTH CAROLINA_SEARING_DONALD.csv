1,1.0,2.0, POLI215,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,"No slides. Talks TO us for entire lecture. Rambles. Unclear prompts for midterm and final essay (40% each). Due to him being late for finals, allowed us to copy our midterm grade to skip finals. I did."
2,3.0,4.0, POLI215,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,"He is very knowledgable and shares a lot of his experiences. I will say that he does not use powerpoints so it is hard to follow at times. He is a tough grader and the class requires a lot of readings. I have taken many poli classes before, but this one had the most readings. "
3,2.0,2.0, POLI432,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,"If you are a minority or LGBTQ, I would advise strongly against this course. He came across as very transphobic and slightly racist in many lectures. It was a very difficult semester to have to sit through his lectures and him playing ""devils advocate"" in a way that invalidated the identity of many people (LGBTQ people primarily).  "
4,3.0,4.0, POLI432,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,"Searing assigns a lot of readings. You are only graded on participation, midterm, a paper, and final. He is a pretty tough grader + he doesnt post them on Sakai so you are basically clueless about your grade. He is monotonous + no visual aids so it is impossible to focus on his lectures. Please just take notes on your readings for exams!!"

6,2.0,4.0, POLI432,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,"Searing is definitely one of the most qualified profs in the dept but his 3 hour long weekly lectures were super dry. My biggest qualm is the lack of clear grading criteria when it comes to the major assignments. Also the class was disorganized, we were constantly behind. A lot of work must go into this class to try and scrounge a good grade."
7,2.0,3.0, POLI432,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,"Searing is an incredibly monotonous lecturer, loves being the devils advocate despite coming off as bigoted/immoral, and is not clear on grading criteria at all. The topic of his class is pretty straight forward, but there is so much reading involved and he is incredibly picky about specifying definition. Take something else if u can - it sucked."
8,5.0,3.0, POLI215,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,"I LOVED this class! It is super interesting and relevant, but there is a ton of reading. There is a good mix of Professor Searing lecturing and student-led discussions. The mid-term and final both have a lot of weight on your grade, but Professor Searing is a fair grader."
9,5.0,3.0, POLI432,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,"Professor Searing is obviously invested in the material, and his use of case studies grounds theory in reality. He explains the concepts well, but my favorite part of the class was when he would recount instances in which issues of tolerance arose in his own life, whether in the field doing research or among his friends and family."
10,4.0,3.0, POLI432,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,"Nice professor, wants students to critically think and engage with the subject matter. Really values participation and is usually nice about summarizing readings during class to make sure people understand. Very fair and I would definitely recommend"
11,5.0,3.0, POLI215,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,Dr. Searing is my favorite professor at UNC. He's extremely kind and very knowledgeable. His class is 2.5 hours of just talking but the subject matter is so interesting you won't care. He is great at explaining things. Take his class you won't regret it
12,4.0,3.0, POLI432,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,"Course/material is very interesting, just be prepared to sit through nearly 3 hours of talking with a 15 minute break"
13,5.0,3.0, POLI432,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,SEARING,Poli 432 is by far the best class I have taken at UNC. I can't recommend Professor Searing high enough. His maymester course consisted of two exams and some participation assignments but the subject matter is so interesting you won't mind participating. The readings aren't too bad and you get to watch a couple films. You won't regret taking this!
