1,5.0,2.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,"This class was challenging, but Professor Martin always did her best to help students grasp difficult concepts. I came into this class with no coding experience, but I learned so much by the end of the semester. I would highly recommend taking her class. She is also very lenient with grading and she is always available to help students. "
2,5.0,3.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,"Professor Martin made coding so much less scary than I thought it would be. I knew nothing coming in, and was able to complete a large scale project by the end of the semester. She is so patient and will always give help when you look for it. I cannot recommend her enough. "
3,5.0,2.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,"POLI281 is pretty difficult subject material, but Dr. Martin's lectures made it really easy to understand. You have a long time to work on the homework assignments and collaboration with other students is encouraged. As a major who wants to follow this career path, this was exactly what I was looking for from this class."
4,5.0,3.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,"Dr. Martin is one of the best UNC professors if you have the chance to take her class do it!  The content was a bit difficult, but she gives students opportunities to ask for help when needed.  She is very caring and was willing to push several due dates back when needed.  I thought I'd hate the class bc it is coding but she made it really easy."
5,5.0,3.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,Professor Martin is super competent and makes learning coding easier than it should be. She is also super accessible outside of class if you are struggling along with the ULAs.
6,5.0,3.0, POLI431,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,Lucy is a goat and any political science student at Carolina should be ashamed if they don't take a class with her. 
7,5.0,4.0, POLI431,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,"I have loved Prof Martin! She is really funny and generally pretty kind. She seems to have really high expectations, but I'm not sure how much of that is just the expectation for a 400-level class. Lectures are very fast-paced, tough to take written notes. Grade is mostly papers and exams, but decently fair grader!"
8,5.0,3.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,Prof Martin is one of the best professors I had at UNC. She is extremely caring and understanding while still challenging students to learn and expand their skills. I came in with very little knowledge of the material and ended the class thoroughly enjoying it. She was always willing to meet to discuss the material and assignments. 10/10 professor!
9,5.0,3.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,Professor Martin is one of my favorite professors i've had while at UNC. She teaches 281 very well and will ALWAYS answer any questions that people have. The ULAs are also very helpful on assignments and group work is fun if your group is engaged. Would definitely recommend this class with Prof. Martin!
10,5.0,2.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,"Professor Martin taught this class very well. Generally, each class consisted of half lecture time and half hands-on practice time. Prof Martin and the LAs were always available for the practice time, so it was very easy to get help if you didn't fully understand the lecture. Not hard to get an A if you go to lectures and do the practices."
11,5.0,4.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,"Very difficult class, but Martin is extremely caring and aware of the difficulties this class possesses. She is flexible with deadlines and is always willing to help. Genuinely cares about students learning and overall well-being."
12,5.0,2.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,"Professor Martin is by far the greatest professor I have ever had. She is kind, understanding, and resourceful. The material is difficult especially if you are not much of a tech person, however, Professor Martin and the ULAs will help you on every assignment. As long as you put in the work and ask for help, you will succeed in this course."
13,5.0,4.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LUCY,MARTIN,"Professor Martin was great! The class isn't easy, but it's also not prohibitively difficult. I came in with no knowledge of coding and left feeling like I can actually use this software in my day-to-day life. She was incredibly flexible and understanding both pre and post-coronavirus, and was very mindful to look out for her students. I recommend."
