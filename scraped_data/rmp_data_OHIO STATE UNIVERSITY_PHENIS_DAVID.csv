1,3.0,4.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"Dr. Phenis is a pretty nice guy. Had some issues with my group (group work is VERY important in this class) and he was willing to grade group projects individually. Attendance isn't mandatory but don't take that to heart, you need the lectures. There's plenty of extra credit available, I would do it weekly to help with learning the material."
2,3.0,1.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,Weird class setup that makes it hard not to earn a good grade. Gave an incredible amount of extra credit and allows you to remediate everything but the exams twice. Bland lecturer but he is knowledgeable about the material.  
3,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"Great professor, very knowledgeable. Amazing class for all neuro majors, as it gives you so much info. Interested grading scale, that seemed to be good for most people. Overall a great prof. "
4,2.0,3.0, PSY2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"phenis gets a bad rap, but he has sm fair policies to give you a good grade. attendance isn't mandatory, he records every class & posts slides, allows you to submit any assignment late (just fill out a late form), minimal hw, extra credit, etc. even if u get a bad group, he'll grade individually if u just reach out & he will help in any way. b nice"
5,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! He made me feel dumb and laughed in my face when I was trying to explain how I interpreted the material. His grading system is so confusing and shouldn't be allowed. I would give him a -100 if I could. Please wait to take this course with another professor, idk how I passed"
6,2.0,5.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"Maybe this class is better if you get a decent group. I wouldn't know, my group was awful.
Quizzes are fine if you look over slides, but the final is absolutely brutal despite a lot of studying. Appreciated that he'd let you get quiz points back through review.
Seems nice and knowledgeable, but the way the course is structured makes it so hard!"
7,1.0,3.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"This class is mostly group work so if you participate and have a good group you will get a good grade. BUT lectures are extremely difficult to understand and the final is near impossible. You can tell he knows the topic well,but explains them in the most bland, boring and most un-understandable way that makes the class impossible to learn materials"
8,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,He will do whatever he can to help you get an A. You can redo all quizzes and assignments (which are all open note anyways) and he even does quizzes with the entire class together and gives everyone full credit. All lectures are available on zoom and as long as you pay attention you should get an A.
9,4.0,2.0, PSY2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"The one thing I can recommend is do the extra credit as you go!! It helps you study for the quizzes every week and is super easy! This class is heavy on group projects and meeting with your group every week to work towards the final original research article, but you all get gradely separately so others work doesn't affect you! "
10,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,For 3313 there is no group work and you can correct your quizzes up to a 100%. Dr. Phenis is very knowledgeable about the topic but his lectures are slide heavy. If you can pay attention in class he is an excellent professor. Grades are basically determined by how much work you put in since you can correct everything to a 100% besides the final.
11,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"What I liked about his class was that there was lots of opportunity for extra credit and remediations to bring up assignment/quiz grades up to 100%. He posted his lectures online and all assignments/quizzes are open book open note. However, his actual teaching method was hard to follow and not very clear. "
12,2.0,4.0, PSY2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"Dr. Phenis is a great professor who really knows what he is talking about, and he is really passionate. I just found the class to be really hard for an 'entry level' class. I am not wanting to go into research in psychology, but those who are would really benefit from this class. The quizzes are easy, but the projects are a lot. "
13,5.0,5.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"Dr. Phenis was the best professor I have had yet at OSU. Dr. Phenis does a phenomenal job bridging the basics to detailed aspects of the complex topics
discussed. He really emphasizes learning and understanding the concepts by allowing TWO makeups per assessment/reflection/quiz. Everything in this class is open book/notes. Take with a grain of salt"
14,5.0,2.0, PSY2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"Prof. Phenis was a great professor for both classes I had him. Very understanding and gives thorough feedback to questions. Lots of group work, but nothing too difficult. Would take his classes again!"
15,2.0,3.0, PSY2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,You can tell Prof. Phenis really knows what he talks about and that he is truly fascinated by psychology. With that being said this whole class was based on 3 big group assignments which sucks. Luckily I got a good group but if your group sucks you're screwed. There are open note quizzes and a cumulative final. Attendance mandatory on group days.
16,2.0,3.0, PSY2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,The professor is a nice guy but he talks so much that you will be confused I promise you. Also the majority of your grade will be based on these three group projects so pray you get a good group. I had a great group and we struggled together to get through each assignment. 
17,2.0,4.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"Dr. Phenis is clearly a wicked smart man. He knows what he is talking about but the issue is he explains the content in a way which is hard to understand.Also, your entire grade of the class is dependent on group projects, so good luck if you get randomly assigned bad partners!"
18,4.0,3.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"dr. phenis responded to emails quickly, but he is a slow grader. 3 big group assignments with weekly group meetings, weekly open note quizzes, and a final. super nice guy, just often overcomplicated the material. tons of extra credit, the material is just boring but he is not a bad professor by any means. posts lectures and slides on carmen."
19,2.0,4.0, PSYC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"While he was very knowledgeable on the topics, I found that he didn't do as well translating it to his students.  I often was left confused and he was very hard to reach via email.  He wouldn't email me back about assignments or questions often until a week later.  I would not recommend this professor unless you are already well-versed in psych.  "
20,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,PHENIS,"I really liked the set-up of Dr. Phenis' lectures. The information on his slides was well-arranged and was fairly concise yet thorough. This class will definitely require you to apply yourself and make connections between material, but Phenis did a nice job at making complex concepts easier to understand and provided helpful feedback when grading.
