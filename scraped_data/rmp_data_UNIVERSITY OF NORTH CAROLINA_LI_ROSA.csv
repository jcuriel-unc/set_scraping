1,2.0,1.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"She's nice but I didn't enjoy this class much. The content was disinteresting to me, she calls on people at random, and the excessive amount of GRQs was unnecessary. Grading was pretty fair and lots of extra credit. I've taken 8 PSYC classes, I think it may  be harder for people who haven't had psyc experience, especially for a 100-level course."
2,2.0,1.0, PSCY180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"The final project was graded horrendously, along with the other papers throughout the semester. Not really bad grades, but points taken off and no real explanation. She wants to randomly call on people in class too, so be prepared to have an anxiety attack!! "
3,4.0,3.0, PSYC250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"Dr. Li is very passionate and knowledgeable about child development psychology. Two lectures and one group activity each week. Her exams were tough, but she offers enough credit from papers and participation that it is still possible to get an A. She really cares about each of her students, so if you put in the work this is a great class!"
4,5.0,2.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"Dr. Li is a really skilled lecturer, she is engaging and funny. She begins every class by playing music relevant to the topic of the lecture and often includes memes or other pop culture references in her slides. There are several readings, more so in the beginning but they are completely necessary. Big group project at the end. Dr. Li is great."
5,4.0,2.0, PSYC250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"Reading the textbook will get you a better score on the tests than going to every lecture. The lectures weren't the most engaging, but the content was interesting. There's lots of flexibility in the course (EC, dropping the lowest grade in every category other than test) so it's important to be strategic."
6,2.0,3.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"This class is conceptually easy (mostly common sense). The TAs do all of the grading so if you get stuck with one that grades harshly you're out of luck. Dr. Li is not super approachable but she does try to implement feedback. Overall, I think the course content is interesting but don't go in expecting an easy A. "
7,4.0,3.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"This was an interesting class, but wasn't an easy A for a gen-ed requirement. Several papers, a final group project, 3 exams, a final, and frequent check-up quizzes. There's some peer discussion in class, but it is mostly lecture-based. This topic is worth learning about, but it was definitely a more challenging course than I expected it to be. "
8,5.0,2.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,The class isn't hard and the content is interesting. There were three unit exams that were each worth 10%. There were four papers throughout the course and she dropped the lowest paper grade. She also offers a free one-week extension for any one of the papers. The final was an exam and a group project. I highly recommend taking this class. 
9,5.0,3.0, PSYC250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"Professor Li is super accommodating and understanding. Almost every type of assignment has a ""drop lowest"" including participation and papers. She does a great job at making diversity a focus in the course which was refreshing. Lectures were always easy to understand. A lot of textbook readings but that's pretty expected from a psych class. "
10,4.0,3.0, PSYC250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,She was a good professor and her lectures were pretty straightforward but her exams are set to like 20 questions so it was easy to miss one or two and make a B. Quiz every friday but you can take with a group the second try 
11,3.0,2.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"Not many assignments. Pretty easy class, but she's oddly uptight about it. I also noticed she slipped up a few times content-wise, but never corrected herself. And the exams aren't difficult, but they're harder than you'd expect. That said, they're open book and open internet, so even if you don't know something, you can probably find it."
12,5.0,4.0, PSCY180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"She as an amazing teacher, unfortunately I didn't get the best grade because I was focused on other things, but she was amazing and would help you no matter what and would even reach out to you for help when she saw you were struggling. "
13,5.0,3.0, PSYC250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"I have to give her a 5/5 because of her character. The class was quite decent, and the lectures were solid, albeit sometimes a little boring. Rosa was awesome though, I liked it a lot when she made jokes, and she was always highly organized, prepared and understanding. She is an excellent professor and person. "
14,4.0,2.0, PSYC250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"Professor Li is a pretty good professor. The layout of the course is really nice and organized. There's a lot of working in groups, so this would be a good class to take with your friends. The course content is generally very interesting and she explains things well. The work load is very doable. She makes it very easy for her students to succeed"
15,3.0,3.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,Dr. Li was understanding of pandemic stress; you can get an extension on anything. I found this class boring as I knew a lot from being a teen on social-still overcomplicated. Lectures go fast and can be confusing- if you have a q she'll often have you search through the hour long recordings or long readings. A nice person and not hard to get an A
16,2.0,4.0, PSCY180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"60% of your grade is determined by two exams in this class. I have gotten A's in participation, essays, and projects and then grinded for the exams and finished class with an 89.51. I assumed this would round up and I even emailed her but she wouldn't."
17,3.0,4.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,This course is pretty easy but it is impossible to do well in it if you do poorly on the midterm or final. They both make up 60% of your final grade!! Tests count for so much that the other minor assignments barley affect your grade.
18,5.0,2.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"Dr. Li was extremely understanding of COVID and its effects on students and worked hard to overcover the barriers of hybrid learning. Her class is heavily weighted on two exams, but both are completely based on the lectures, and the criteria for assignments were always clearly established. One of my favorite professors in the psych department!"
19,4.0,4.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,"Overall a pretty good class. 60% of the grade comes from two exams so if you don't do well on one it's hard to do well in the class, but what will be on the exam is pretty clear. Several papers/projects, but those were fairly straightforward."
20,2.0,3.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROSA,LI,This course is pretty easy but it is impossible to do well in it if you do poorly on one of the exams. The tests count for so much that the other assignments barley affect your grade. The assignments are mostly group assignments with a group of 2-3 that she selects. This class may have been worth it if it counted as a general education requirement.
