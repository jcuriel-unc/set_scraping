1,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Dr. Parikh is great. She teaches about the things that matter. It wasn't that hard of a class considering it was a stat class. I wouldn't say it should really be a psychology class, though. Either a stats or maybe ethics class, but it wasn't psych heavy at all. The software was super easy to use. "
2,5.0,2.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"I loved having Professor Parikh for this course!  She is super understanding and gives the perfect amount of work that isn't too overwhelming.  Attendance isn't mandatory and is done on PollEv, and there is a midterm and a final that are both open-note and moderate.  Overall, I really enjoyed this class and loved having Parikh as my professor!!"
3,5.0,2.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Dr. Parikh is a great professor, and she really wants her students to do well. This is not a difficult class as long as you attend class and watch the video lectures she posts online. She gives you time to work on the assignments in class and ask questions if you have any. Great class, but beware the final was extremely difficult for no reason. "
4,5.0,2.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Really easy class if you are decently ok at stats. The assignments are written out step by step. She is extremely flexible and caring! The two lowest grades of everything were dropped (minus the exams), but we only had a midterm and final so it was worth it for sure. Recommend! "
5,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Assignments in this class are kinda hard and the TA's grade very harshly depending on which one grades yours.  Final exam was nearly impossible and brought a lot of people's grades down, did not match the energy of other quizzes or midterms in the class, the final was just unnecessarily hard"
6,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Dr. Parikh is an amazing professor. She cares about her students and allows them to work on extra credit. In my opinion, the hardest item in her class is the final. Attendance is not mandatory, but if you do not go you might miss something very important. She also has review sessions that are very helpful. I would definitely take her class again."
7,5.0,2.0, PSYC270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Loved this class, she is very kind and truly cares about her students. She is always offering help and making sure you are graded fairly. You get to select your group for the final paper and although it is really long it is split up throughout the semester so it doesn't feel too bad at the end. "
8,5.0,1.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Does PollEV for attendance. Quizzes and Midterm are super easy, everything is online. Makes sure you never fail and can never get lower than 75 on the comprehension Q's. Some of the assignments can be hard but you are allowed to work in groups. Great professor and wants you to pass with an A and you will understand the material, if not you'll be ok"
9,5.0,2.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Take this class with Prof P! There are online video lectures before each class so you learn at your own pace. She ended class early on Thursdays to give us time to work on the assignments. There are weekly assignments, a few quizzes, and a take-home midterm and final. All quizzes and exams are open-note and online. Super easy and not a lot of work!"
10,5.0,2.0, PSYC270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"There is a reason Professor Parikh has 5/5. She is awesome! There is one semester-long GROUP paper that you submit parts of along the way, so submitting at the end isn't too difficult or overwhelming, and you get feedback. All of her classes were zoomed and did poll ev, and every Friday the whole class was given to work with your group."
11,5.0,2.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Prof P is a gem at UNC. Her classes are insanely easy and I didn't go to class except for FDOC. She zooms her classes and does poll ev, so I just did them from home. Fridays also don't have poll ev's. 1 weekly assignment that took about 1 hour and with the slides were easy. Exams are also take home. If you need a PSYC class, take Prof P!!!!!"
12,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"parikh is very caring and easily accessible! she really just wants everyone to understand the material and succeed. she gives notice of upcoming assignments, quizzes, etc. way ahead of time and it is easy to fit the amount of work she gives into a weekly schedule. it is not exhaustive and adds to your understanding. also extra credit things too!"
13,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Professor Parikh is amazing. I recommend taking any of her classes. There are 10 assignments and 5 quizzes, I  believe, which are easy. The midterm was tough, and the Final was harder, but not impossible. She also allows for extra credit and she is always there in class or in office hours to be able to help if you are confused. Use your resources. "
14,5.0,2.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"I can't say enough good things about Dr. Parikh, she is such a great professor and person! Her lectures are very engaging and she is very kind about deadlines. Her class was also super accessible, as she had a Zoom link up for every class in case anyone had to miss it in person. If you have the chance to take any psyc. class with Dr. Parikh, DO IT!"
15,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"I loved Prof Parikh! Her class was very accessible (offered zoom) and she was such an amazing person overall. Very understanding of personal situations, passionate about the work, caring towards her students. Definitely recommend taking a class with her.
One assignment due a week, very manageable."
16,5.0,2.0, PSYC270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,Love Prof Parikh!! She really cares about her students learning the material and actually getting something from the class. Just do poll ev's and she has zoom options. Pick a good group and you'll be set. Lots of good feedback and easy to get help. Take classes with Prof Parikh. (Also had her for 220 and she was equally amazing) 
17,5.0,2.0, PSYC270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"This class was fairly easy, and prof P's very kind and cool!  Make sure to keep up with assignments and poll ev participation!  Grading may seem a bit rough at fist, but just incorporate feedback into the final project! Provided example assignments help too! Learning checks were not bad as long as you study the notes! Extra credit was given at end!"
18,5.0,2.0, PSYC270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Her lectures are can be boring/redundant but she is always there if you need extra help on the material/research paper. Class is easy as most of your grade is a semester-long project divided into small due dates throughout the semester, the learning checks/final exams are open-note, and 1/3 class are project workdays. Highly recommend taking her! "
19,5.0,2.0, PSYC270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Certainly not one of the most interesting courses at UNC, but Dr. Parikh made it great. This class focused on a semester-long group project with 2 quizzes throughout. Extremely manageable. This was my second class with her and she was still an amazing professor. I recommend her courses to anyone. "
20,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NATASHA,PARIKH,"Dr. Parikh is an amazing professor! If you have the opportunity to take her class, do it! Our class consisted of either an assignment each week or a quiz (although there were only 5 quizzes throughout the semester). The midterm was fairly simple, but the final was a bit more challenging than anything we did in the class."
