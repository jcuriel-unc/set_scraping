1,1.0,4.0, SOCIOL3549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"If you need to take this course and struggle with statistics or math, use a different professor. She is impossible to reach outside of her limited class time, her office hours are also not easily flexible/accessible. After getting 2 tutors, I realized she made the material more difficult than necessary, especially asking students w/ other teachers"
2,5.0,4.0, SOCIOL3549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"I'm taking Kristi's Statistics course for Sociology and I feel inclined to rate her because she is one of the most understanding and caring teachers I have ever met. After COVID-19, she has gone out of her way to help. The assignments graded most heavily are the exams and the homework. Midterm was a challenge, but homework is very straightforward."
3,2.0,4.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"she does not teach students, you have to teach yourself and attend lab to learn in this class"
4,4.0,4.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"Kristi's class was a real joy to take. Though heavy on in-depth readings each week with corresponding discussion questions, a couple of those grades are dropped so you can catch a few breaks. Definitely challenging and interesting to anybody interested in sociology. TA's helpful. Exams require very little study if you've been paying attention."
5,5.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"Kristi had great online lectures, which led to great notes, which then led to easy assignments. Only had to study twice for this class. Enjoyed her in class lectures too, even if they weren't necessary besides the attendance."
6,1.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"I did not enjoy her class at all because she professes her opinion more so than the actual material. She teaches from one perspective and does not really like to see any others. She's also a bit crazy... I would have liked this class much more if she made it more modern and relatable. A lot of outside of class, busy bs work."
7,3.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"The class was very easy, however, there were many assignments. Many assignments could be dropped. It was half in class and half online which I preferred. Dr. Williams was a bit wacky at times but lectures had some important information."
8,3.0,2.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"Very easy class, if you half attempt to do the work, you'll get an A. It's a hybrid class, so the lecture videos are online and followed by a quiz on Canvas. I never actually watched the lectures, just copied the notes and the quiz was easy. Discussion questions are hard and the reading are way too extensive."
9,5.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"I enjoyed Sociology 1101 with Professor Williams. The exams are straightforward (info is directly from lecture video slides, online quizzes, and discussion questions). The discussion questions require a lot of reading; I would consider them the most difficult part of the course. The class is interesting and not bad overall if you put some time in."
10,1.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"Prof Williams seems like a nice enough person, but as an instructor she puts no work into the class. The lecture videos were recorded in the past and in class she tries to get people to argue about controversial topics. When she grades the project she does not grade fairly and will release her wrath on you if you question her."
11,3.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"Online lectures were the only thing that you needed to take notes on, because the class lectures were a repeat of the online ones. She assigns a TON of reading that is graded extremely tough by her TAs. The tests are easy and they are mostly made of quiz and discussion questions so as long as you study a little and do the homework, you are fine."
12,5.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"Dr. William's class was a hybrid class, meaning half online, half in-person. There were ""lecture videos"" given at the beginning of the week, followed by an easy quiz regarding the video. Later in the week, we met in class and went over discussion questions. If you are considering taking this class as a GE, do it. Dr. Williams is great"
13,3.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"This was a hybrid course. Really boring in-class lecture, most people left after she took attendance. Tests are all definition based, you don't even need to fully watch the video lectures, just get the definitions from the slides and you'll be fine with the quizzes and tests. Discussion questions are super hard and the TA's grading are tough"
14,4.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,Great teacher. Is very engaging and makes classes so incredibly easy for you as long as you put even half the energy into things that she asks you can do very well here.
15,5.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,Dr. Williams is an absolutely amazing professor who teaches the material very well. Attendance is mandatory as every class you answer a question and turn it in for participation points. The class is pretty easy if you just do the work and the hardest part is the discussion questions because the readings can be difficult but they are interesting.
16,3.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"Very easy class and very forgiving grading. Could get by with a B by doing the bare minimum and an A if just a little work is put in. Dr. Williams herself seems passionate about Sociology. Lectures were never really great or horrible, pretty average."
17,4.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"Online quizzes, that are open note from the online lecture videos, and there are 4 attempts for each quiz. 2 lowest quiz grades get dropped. 11 sets of 4 Discussion questions, one set due each week. Highest 6 grades on discussion sets are kept. 3 midterms and an optional final exam, only the 3 highest exam grades are kept. Exams are multiple choice"
18,4.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"Tests are very straightforward. The questions mainly come from the online quizzes and discussion question answers (which she gives you in class). Class is once a week and she takes attendance. Drops many assignments. Three tests and an optional final, lowest test is dropped. Super easy and she's very nice. Highly recommend for an easy A."
19,5.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,"Prof Williams was such a highlight in my first semester. She is interesting, and she runs a well-structured class. She makes lectures interesting and enjoyable. The only part that sucked was discussion questions, but she has a system where she only takes your top 6 scores out of 11. I love her and would take her again in a heartbeat. She cares!"
20,5.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTI,WILLIAMS,The sociology class I took was half online and half in class. Very easy class. Kristi will literally do everything she can to help you out with grades. Honestly there is no reason that anyone should get less than a B in this class.
