1,1.0,2.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"Complete waste of time. Easy diversity credit for poli sci, but get ready to learn nothing. Even though the class is listed as a feminist class, no one is passionate about the material. Any alternative viewpoints are shut down, and if you just regurgitate her viewpoints to her you will get a good grade. The class is all online as well."
2,5.0,2.0, POLI063,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,The class was all online but Professor Conover is great. Flipped classroom but the content is interesting and she never assigns so much that it's overwhelming. Very clear criteria for projects/papers and is a very generous grader. Recommend if you're okay with an online class.
3,5.0,1.0, POLI063,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER," Once a week zoom meeting where you discuss class topics. Only 3 group papers (graded very forgivingly), and 3 forums posts. No exams and an easy final project. Very interesting topics covered with low commitment, should be an easy A if you do the work! Professor Conover is very understanding and I highly recommend her!

4,4.0,3.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"This class was exhausting. Coming from a feminist Poli Sci Major, you can make a good grade but it takes an unnecessary amount of work. Lectures were long and we had soooo much reading everyday. The content is interesting but the format is tiring. Like I said you can make a good grade but its not really worth the work required. "
5,4.0,3.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"The class was definitely reading and homework heavy, too much so at times. However, Dr. Conover provided interesting material, was very organized, and fair with quizzes and forum posts. You had to stay engaged, but she was very understanding of special circumstances and was warm and welcoming overall. Would recommend, but be ready to work!"
6,4.0,1.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,We only had class once a week and hardly any assignments. Frequent short quizzes but they were scheduled. She was very nice but with the class being online it was hard to really form a relationship. A few group projects.
7,3.0,3.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,I had Conover online and we had one meeting per week. She is a tough grader and it takes forever for her to grade stuff. Her grading criteria is nitpicky + difficult to please. She has a horrible internet connection and class is therefore difficult. Her work is organized but you have to teach yourself everything. She did not answer emails promptly.
8,2.0,4.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"I did not enjoy POLI 217 or Professor Conover all that much at all. I felt like she relied heavily on her out-of-class work and felt like the ""lectures"" were really just a discussion on how other students saw the problems discussed in that week's material instead of her actually teaching. Essentially, I taught myself the material. Not fun"
9,2.0,3.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"Professor Conover is clearly a well educated individual in Political Science and I do like her but the amount of articles, essays, and other readings she assigns on a week to week basis was overwhelming. Also, she is hard to get a hold of consistently and if you are not in class with her, her responsiveness was poor."
10,2.0,3.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"I found the subject matter boring and her approach to be somewhat as well. Any time you have a relatively boring subject and the teacher is not very energetic about it, I find it to be hard to learn. I also thought the method she taught the course made it harder for success in her class."
11,5.0,3.0, POLI063,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"I loved Professor Conover for Poli 63. The class is so interesting and Conover is so nice and makes understanding the material easy. She makes PowerPoints for you to listen to, which go by fast, I took notes on them to use in class discussions. Please do the readings to be prepared for class, or they will be boring!! Super easy quizzes too!"
12,4.0,1.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"Overall good professor and not too rough of a grader, as long as you do forum posts on time, you should be fine. Pretty much an easy A if you put in some work with the readings and the posts and show up and talk in class!"
13,3.0,3.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"2 Forums worth 35%. Points lost for posts in quick succession or close to due date. Struggled on forum2 bc of COVID & got a B. Got solid A's on everything else (group project, paper, forum1, etc) but just 1 B dropped my class grade to a B (even if I got 100% on the final). All because of the timing of my (not late) forum posts... during a pandemic."
14,2.0,3.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,Professor Conover is a nice woman however the class was dull and she was extremely boring. The group projects and assignments had vague guidelines and the majority of your grade was determined by forum posts. It wasn't a very difficult class and the subject matter was very interesting but something about the way the class was run made it bad.
15,5.0,3.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,i recommend her whenever i can she was great. the online forum posts help your participation grade if you do them diligently especially if you aren't a talk in class person.
16,5.0,4.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"Professor Conover is wonderful and interesting in all of her lectures. Its easy to get overwhelmed and fall behind in the readings and the blog posts, but she makes the work worth it."
17,5.0,3.0, POLI063,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"You could clearly tell that Professor Conover cared about her students. She listened to our input and stories and showed true concern. There was a lot of reading, but because there are no exams it wasn't necessary to do them. By attending class, participating, posting on forums, and writing the papers (which were graded forgivingly) you will get A."
18,5.0,3.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,"Took Poli50 and Poli217 because I liked her so much. She really challenges students in discussion over class material, without implementing her political biases like most professors. If you participate and actually try on assignments, you can get an A. Also, final exams are open note and you get questions beforehand to prepare for."
19,5.0,3.0, POLI217,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,PROF CONOVER IS AMAZING. It is clear she is very knowledgeable in her subject and the lectures are great. Attendance is via poll everyone questions on the readings and the readings are pretty interesting. 10/10 take this class if you can.
20,5.0,2.0, POLI63,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PAMELA,CONOVER,Professor Conover made classes fun and interesting. Grading wasn't super difficult and there weren't any tests. She's a super sweet person and I really liked this class!
