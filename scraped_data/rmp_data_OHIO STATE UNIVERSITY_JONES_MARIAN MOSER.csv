1,4.0,3.0, HISTORY2703,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIAN MOSER,JONES,"This is a professor who hopes to teach students by letting them reflect and apply the material rather than restating it, which is a great thing for a professor, but the exams were more difficult than I had anticipated. On the other hand, she is very nice and I learned a lot from her lectures. "
2,5.0,3.0, HISTORY2703,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIAN MOSER,JONES,"Dr. Jones clearly shows her passion and knowledge of the history of public health and her lectures can be entertaining. There are weekly lecture quizzes that are simple and reinforce the important points of lecture. You can generally get away with not doing readings as she goes over them in lecture. Overall, solid professor!"
3,4.0,4.0, 3610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIAN MOSER,JONES,"Dr. Jones has a very well formatted and organized class. There is a lot of material & weekly, frequent, and sometimes time consuming homework or exams. Make sure you watch lecture videos, they are informative and cover quiz material directly. Major quizzes are hard and specific, and exams are the same way. Assignments are  time consuming teach you."
4,2.0,3.0, 3610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIAN MOSER,JONES,"Dr. Jones online class is a mess. Dates and assignments are frequently wrong/ unpublished. She also does not post what is due for the week's module until Monday, which means that you can never plan ahead for this class (due dates are on the Sunday of that week). Takes forever to grade and provides very little feedback. "
