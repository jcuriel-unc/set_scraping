1,5.0,4.0, POLISCI3420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,Incredibly smart and educated professor. Great class. Lots of information in a short amount of time. Very quiet speaker but values opinions and discussion. Not an easy A but you will get a lot out of this class if you put the effort in. 
2,5.0,5.0, POLISCI3420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"One of the smartest / best professors I have had at OSU. This class will stretch your mind and you will grow as a student. Very discussion based. However, this is not an easy class. Does not round grade. You will have to put in a lot of work. You will be able to use what you learn in her class in other classes. Highly recommended"
3,5.0,3.0, POLISCI3420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"She is so engaging and wants everyone to do well in class. She is big on participation during discussions but if you talk to her she will include you in the discussions. Easily accessible outside of class. Her class is not an easy A, but probably one of the smartest professors in the Political Science department. Can not recommend her enough!"
4,5.0,2.0, POLISCI3420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,Dr.Saunders-Hastings is a phenomenal instructor and keeps the class engaged. She provides clear instructions and keeps everything organized. She provides excellent feedback on papers and she gives great advice about research. 
5,5.0,5.0, PS5413,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"Amazing professor, challenging but wildly interesting & enjoyable course. Dr. Saunders-Hastings was very supportive, always accessible outside of class, seems genuinely invested in students' growth. I never felt overlooked even as an undergrad in a graduate course. One of my favorite classes/profs to date!"
6,5.0,3.0, POLITSC3450,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"This was one of my favorite classes. Professor Saunders-Hastings is so smart and our readings and lectures were always very engaging and interesting. It was not too hard either as long as you show up, engage and do the readings. I really enjoyed this class and got a lot out of it."
7,5.0,4.0, PS3450,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"An absolute queen. She is one of my favorite professors at Ohio State. The class can be hard, but it's doable as long as you stay on top of the readings and show up every day. She encourages you to explore your own ideas in papers and she is one of the smartest people I've ever met. Really knows the ins and outs of political theory. Overall 10/10"
8,5.0,4.0, POLITSCI3450,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"She is so nice and helpful. If you have any suggestions, she is always willing to listen and is always looking to improve your learning experience. Definitely do the reading though and definitely participate. She was never judgmental of the ideas you have and always willing to explore them in more depth. Overall I really like her as a professor."
9,5.0,4.0, POLITSCI3450,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"Very difficult but rewarding class. Took this for my minor and it was one of my favorites of the semester. I think it's a testament to a professor about how they handled the COVID-19 situation and ESH made the transition smooth and was very understanding. She is obviously very intelligent but is a tough grader, and the class has a LOT of reading."
10,2.0,4.0, PS3450,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"This course is very objective, it is almost all based on philosophy. If you don't have an original idea or agree with prof. you may receive a bad grade on papers on tests. She grades off how much effort she thinks you gave. Also, she will tear you apart in your papers even though there are no clear-cut guidelines on what she really wants."
11,5.0,3.0, POLITSC3440,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"Dr. Saunders-Hastings definitely knows what shes doing; shes clearly knowledgeable on analyzing political arguments. 3440 was extremely reading intensive, but the readings were all valuable and had a clear purpose in the course. Shes super approachable; 10/10 would recommend."
12,4.0,2.0, POLITSC3440,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"Dr. Saunders-Hastings is extremely knowledgeable on many topics and conceptualizes political theory like none other. The class however, is extremely reading-intensive, and it can be very easy to fall behind in the difficulty and the amount of readings given. Dont take her class if youre looking for an easy grade-booster, youll get the opposite."
13,5.0,4.0, POLISCI3420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"Dr. Saunders-Hastings is outstanding. Her class is demanding, but it was the most intellectually engaging class I've taken in college. She is wicked smart, accessible outside of class, and is really caring and gives positive feedback. She is overall incredible and so good at guiding class discussion and analyzing the nuances of political theories."
14,2.0,4.0, POLITSC3420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"Do not take this class if you want your grade to be determined by 4 things. 2 of the grades in this class are done by the TA and the other 2 are a midterm and a final. There is no and I mean NO wiggle room if you do poorly on one assignment. All the ""answers"" in this class are subjective which should lean towards leniency but there is none."
15,5.0,5.0, POLITSC3450,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,"I absolutely loved having Prof. Saunders-Hastings! Shes incredibly intelligent, and she very much knows her way around political theory. Some of the readings were dense, but she was very understanding and approachable about them, and it was quite apparent how thoughtfully she put together the syllabus. I would die for her, honestly. Amazing prof."
16,5.0,4.0, POLITSC3450,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,EMMA,SAUNDERS-HASTINGS,Prof Saunders-Hastings is so smart and knowledgable. I learned sooo much from this class and it was super interesting. It's not the easiest class but if you put in a decent amount of effort there's no reason you shouldn't succeed.
