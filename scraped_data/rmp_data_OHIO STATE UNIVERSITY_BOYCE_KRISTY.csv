1,4.0,2.0, PSCYH4475,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"This class was very boring but easy. There were some interesting parts, but only reason I went is because of TopHat. Lectures are extremely long (20+ slide) and she will tell you to read the book, but you don't need to. I would have had an A in the class, but I got docked points on my project! "
2,5.0,1.0, PSCYH4475,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,This class was very easy in terms of assignments and quizzes. Her lectures get a little boring but she is extremely nice and very caring! Attendance wasn't required.
3,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3325,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,Professor Boyce was so caring and you can really tell that she is passionate about her field. Lectures were organized and to the point and she took measures to make sure everyone understood everything she was teaching. I would definitely take another one of her classes.
4,4.0,1.0, PSYCH3530,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"Good professor, easy class. Don't need to read textbook, tests are easy. She records the lectures, but I'm not sure if that's because of COVID. Would probably be boring if I had to go to class because it takes me 15 minutes to watch each lecture once I skip past everything irrelevant and play it at double speed. She's caring and easygoing."
5,5.0,1.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"The only assignments were two group projects, 3 exams, and REP participation, so if you got a bad group things were awful. Lectures were straightforward, and she provides PDFs of the slides to take notes on. Open-note exams. Highly recommend."
6,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"The lectures were pretty boring for me, but Dr. Boyce does everything she can to make class more fun. She is very kind and helpful."
7,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3530,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"She gives a lot of work and the class requires you to read the entire textbook due to inquizitive. She does seem like she cares about the students but thats hard to display in an online course. There are no cumulative exams, just quizzes every other week on the chapters we worked on. There also is no final."
8,5.0,1.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"Dr. Boyce really wants her students to do well. Her lectures are super clear and she gives guided notes for each one. There are a couple of group projects and a presentation but they aren't too bad. Midterms and final are online, non-cumulative, open note. She is incredibly nice too."
9,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"One of the best instructors I have ever had. She gave on-topic and focused lectures, was understanding of personal circumstances, and was highly accessible outside of class. Go to class and take notes, and you will do well while learning a lot. Absolutely amazing professor!"
10,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,Exceptional professor and made one of my first classes at OSU enjoyable!
11,5.0,1.0, PSYCH4475,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"This is my second class was Dr. Boyce. Not only are her classes typically pretty easy for upper-division courses, but she is also an amazing person. She will put in extra work to make sure you understand the material."
12,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3325H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"Truly an amazing person. Overall, the class content is very easy to understand, and watching her lecture slides prior to the lecture was plenty for the quizzes. Everything was open-note and pretty simple. Just do the assignments and you will be very successful!"
13,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3230,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"She is very clear on the assignments and their due dates, always sending email reminders to get them done. The exams were open book and times, but if you read the chapter you would easily get an A. There are weekly readings and mini-quizzes about the chapter, as well as homework, but it was all very manageable and open book."
14,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3530,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"Dr. Boyce's class was pretty interesting. I appreciated the fact that her lecture videos managed to be succinct while covering almost everything we needed to know. There were quizzes every other week, which were usually pretty easy if you watched the lectures and read the textbook, and the HW was generally easy points, too. Definitely recommend!"
15,4.0,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"Dr. Boyce was very kind in her feedback, though I never interacted with her in person. Her class was easy and the criteria was clear while learning a lot. It was a great intro class, not too intense but I learned enough."
16,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"Dr. Boyce is an easy grade and assignments are easy. I took this class asynchronously, so all of the quizzes were open note. Dr. Boyce is also extremely understanding and gives everyone two ""oops"" passes to get extensions on the assignments. She also provides opportunity for extra credit."
17,5.0,2.0, PSYCH325H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"Professor Boyce is awesome! I learned so much from this class and would definitely take her again. Assignments and tests are straightforward, and there are extra credit opportunities. If you just pay attention during lecture and have a rough understanding of the weekly articles, you'll be fine. Overall this was a very easy class."
18,5.0,2.0, PSYCH325H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"Dr. Boyce is awesome. Her class is super informative, and she's great at teaching the material. If you do the work, you'll get the grade you want."
19,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,"A good course to fill your schedule with if you're already slammed. The assignments are very short and she gives guided notes for you to write in while reading the textbook. If you pay attention to the material and put effort into discussions/journals, you're sure to get an A"
20,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTY,BOYCE,Go to class because all the notes are taken in class. You don't need a textbook or anything but remember there is no curve. I was .01 away from an A and could not be rounded but overall she is a super nice professor and it should be easy as long as you study.
