1,2.0,4.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"The most inaccessible professor I have ever had. Sent over ten extremely important emails throughout the semester and never once got a response. Even when it concerned mistakes in grading and time sensitive questions. Nice guy, passionate about teaching, but his inability to respond or communicate is not fair to his students. "
2,4.0,3.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,Ecstatic about course material wants students to engage. Very understanding. The class was a bit out of my comfort zone because the second half of the class is a simulation of ancient Athens including everyone giving a speech. A lot of people get into the simulation. it's not hard it just can be difficult if you're shy to get into character. 
3,2.0,4.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"Do not take. The second half of the class is a simulation, which is cool, but it is extremely disorganized and your grade will pay the price. Also, most of the class suffered from his extremely vague and random choice of questions for the midterm. Grade does not reflect how much you know or how hard you worked, which is unfair. "
4,2.0,4.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"Very nice and funny but extremely disorganized and difficult to reach outside of class. Respect him a lot as a person, but I do not recommend taking a class with him simply because of these issues. "
5,5.0,2.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"I had Professor Weidenfeld for Poli 59 and it was a great experience. Not only does he create a classroom environment that is fun to be in, but he also does a great job at teaching the material. Grades in the class are unfortunately on few things, but he is a generous grader and you should be fine if you do the reading. Overall, highly recommend."
6,4.0,2.0, POLI271,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,I don't like theory classes but Weidenfeld made this one bearable and even interesting to a degree. His lectures were always thought-provoking and the assignments & quizzes were pretty easy. The historical simulation/roleplay in the last 6 weeks was super unconventional in a fun way. Make sure you understand the theories and you'll be good to go.
7,5.0,3.0, POLI271,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"Weidenfeld is an incredible and engaging lecturer who made me want to attend class. None of the assignments were too hard and the exams were very fair. However, grading is up to the TA's so keep that in mind. Just attend  and pay attention class, understand the readings, and put thought/effort in your assignments and you will be fine!"
8,5.0,2.0, POLI270,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"Prof Weidenfeld uses some unconventional but highly entertaining methods in some of his courses, including a complicated role-playing historical simulation in this course. The latter half of the class was some of the most fun I've ever had in college, and his encouragement of engagement and questions in the lecture half was great. Would recommend."
9,5.0,2.0, POLI271,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"Professor Weidenfeld is an awesome teacher to have. He is super passionate about the material and has engaging lectures. Really hated the content of POLI 271 so I didn't like the class, but Weidenfeld as a professor is awesome!"
10,5.0,2.0, POLI476,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,Whether you are a poli major or not you HAVE to take this class with Weidenfeld. I took this class as a freshman and it still is my favorite class I have ever taken at UNC. Weidenfeld is so funny and helpful with the simulation. You basically become the constitutional convention and is seriously is the most fun!! 
11,5.0,3.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"Professor Weidenfeld's class was engaging and entertaining and I really enjoyed the way he set up the simulation. The workload wasn't terrible - two papers, two speeches, four quizzes - but quizzes can be tough. Be prepared to participate in class and read a lot of political theory, but the class is really fun overall and I would take it again."
12,4.0,2.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"So chill, amazing guy. Reminds me of Hamilton debate kid class. If you like history, absolutely take it. Readings are kinda difficult, but he gives notes in class. 2 papers and 2 speeches total, not too bad. Never knew what was going on, but it was still fine. Hard quizzes but they are online and answers on quizlet, let us take some w/ groups."
13,5.0,3.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"Weidenfeld is the best professor I've had at UNC. This class simulated the French and American Revolutions and everyone played a character. I was scared that it would be a lot of work, and it is (a lot of reading, political thought, and meetings outside of class) but it's fun and not unmanageable. Take it!"
14,5.0,3.0, POLI271,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"Echoing other students here, the man makes the cumbersome world of Political Theory deeply enjoyable! He makes dated philosophizing relevant today, and helps guide ones imagination to the meat of the info, so we may critique it better. My only complaint is hes so good he seems like hes juggling numerous responsibilities at times. Still love him."
15,5.0,4.0, POLI180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"I loved Dr. Weidenfeld's class. I was a freshman STEM major in a POLI class full of seniors so I felt a bit out of my element but ultimately was happy. Fun game structure. There isn't much to grade (3 papers and two or three exams) but that's it, so beyond that, you work as much as you want for your role. Teaches you much more beyond poli sci"
16,5.0,3.0, POLI471,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"Great professor who is passionate about the material and an outgoing guy. The readings are challenging and he doesn't use PowerPoints. You'll have to be able to pick up on larger themes and ideas instead of details. The simulation was fun and a great way to conclude the course. I recommend this course, the stuff you learn will apply to your life."
17,5.0,3.0, POLI471,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,I love Professor Weidenfeld! You can clearly tell that he is incredibly passionate about the materials he teaches. I am taking this 400+ class as a freshman but I really loved it! He makes everything fun! My best online learning experience! The exams are very doable. The midterm paper was challenging but only the second draft is graded so its fine
18,5.0,3.0, POLI471,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"Coming from a Poli major, prof. Weidenfeld is probably the best teacher in the department. His lectures are engaging, personal, and entertaining. He's very knowledgeable about the material and he solicits and respects different interpretations of it. The workload and grading are intimidating at first but really are on par with most other courses."
19,5.0,1.0, POLI476,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"This was probably my favorite class at UNC! Dr. Weidenfeld really cares about what hes teaching and makes it fun. I thought the simulation was going to be a little intimidating at first, but it was actually pretty chill and hilarious. If you have a chance to take this class, do it!"
20,5.0,3.0, POLI271,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MATTHEW,WEIDENFELD,"LOVED this class! Political theory is tough, but Weidenfeld really breaks it down and makes it easy to understand. Very engaging lecturer and super interactive class. Papers and exams are tough, but if you go to office hours, do the readings, and go to class, you'll be fine."
