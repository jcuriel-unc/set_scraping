1,2.0,5.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ZEYNEP,SAYGIN,"I definitely not recommend taking this class with her. She is super nice, but nice well experienced with the material. She reads from slides most of the time and her exam questions are not related to what she gave in the lecture."
2,5.0,4.0, PSYCH5628,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ZEYNEP,SAYGIN,Hard class but makes you think. Expects a high level of understanding of journal articles. Fun lectures and she obviously cares about the material. Presentations have to be well thought out. Be prepared to discuss the articles in class. Debate at the end of the semester helps bring it all together.
3,4.0,3.0, PSYCH5628,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ZEYNEP,SAYGIN,"Like a lot of grad classes in psych I found this one to not be very informative. I learned a few things. Some of it was repeated from lower level courses, or the lectures were very mundane. Graded items are three presentations, and short weekly response paper to articles, which are difficult to read. Make sure your presentations are very detailed."
