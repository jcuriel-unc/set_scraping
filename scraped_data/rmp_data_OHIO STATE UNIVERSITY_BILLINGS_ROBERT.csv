1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,exellent teacher. very clear and organized as he managed to make research ethics interesting. very fair grader.
2,4.5,1.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"As long as you read the text or go to lecture, the tests are cake. I went to lecture more than half the time, but it wasn't really necessary. He was pretty funny and the lectures were not bad at all. Do the 3 hw assignments just in case you bomb a test. He doesnt curve your grade, so you get what you get. Great professor though."
3,3.0,3.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"As many others have stated, not the most exciting material, but not the worst, either. He does try and throw in a few anecdotes (many about his cat or his wife) to try and make the material relevant. But, when he asks questions (during lecture) he will only agree if you give the answer he wants.  Overall, not too painful.  Notes are posted online"
4,3.5,2.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,Pretty good teacher. The class itself is pretty boring but it isn't difficult. Going to class def makes it a lot easier. He gives an opportunity for extra credit that can really help your grade if you do it.
5,4.0,2.0, PSY300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"No matter who teaches this class it's going to be a boring class. Dr. Billings tries to make it as interesting as possible. He cracks jokes, and tells interesting stories. It's not too bad. Him and his TA helped me a lot in their office. They will be happy to go over exams with you, and explain anything."
6,2.5,5.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"This class was bad, I had to drop it! The information is sooo boring and Dr. Billings was a very stiff teacher. I felt like he wasn't approachable at all. He told us to refer all questions to the TA! Tests are soo hard. Only good thing about the class was the optional surveys or paper for 50 points extra credit. Dont take unless life depends on it."
7,3.5,3.0, PSYCHOLOGY300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"Dr. Billings is a hard teacher.  I would not recommend him.  When he asks questions in class and students answer the question wrong he puts them down and makes them feel dumb.  He does offer extra credit though, and the homeworks are not that hard.  Watch out for the tests they can be killers."
8,5.0,3.0, PSY300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"Pretty hard class but totally doable, but like someone else said, it's extremely easy to get the 50 bonus points, and they do matter since your grade is out of 1000. I thought the class was extremely boring, and this is the first class I have ever taken which you could definitely get an A without going to class; Everything you need is online."
9,5.0,2.0, PSY508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,Good prof. Clear when explaining course material. Very helpful. Worth taking!
10,4.5,3.0, 508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"He is by far the most effective teacher I have had. Regardless of the material, he does a really good job explaining. I actually learned everything in class just my listening to him. Really good at explaining things."
11,4.5,3.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"Tricky class, make sure you understand his testing style and what he thinks is important.  He does give extra credit to help if you didn't do so hot on an exam, but exams aren't easy."
12,3.5,2.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,This class wasn't the hardest but it wasnt the easiest...the tests werent too hard but the paper was a pain. The class was soooo boring and i'm suprised I made it as much as I did!
13,3.5,2.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,The class is really boring but really easy. Just read the book and the notes and you will be fine on the tests.  Can get an easy 50 bonus points which makes getting a good grade even easier.
14,5.0,2.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,made lectures very interesting considering the material. homeworks very easy & offers easy extra credit. do need to spend some time studying for exams though. overall really good prof. would take another class with him again.
15,4.5,1.0, PSY300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"Billings was not the most exciting guy, but he was very helpful and the class was pretty easy.  Just don't take it in the morning, or you will never go to class."
16,4.5,1.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,You can tell he's genuinely interested in the stuff he teaches. Unfortunately the material is still very boring. He puts all the notes online so going to class is purely optional and it really won't hurt your grade to skip as long as you read the notes before the midterm
17,4.5,1.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"The material is dull, but easy to understand.  He gives you the notes online.  50 bonus points if you do some surveys.  I thought this class was much easier than psych 100.  If I recall correctly something like 75% of the class got C+ or above."
18,3.0,3.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,He is kind of arrogant and extremely boring- class not recommended.
19,5.0,2.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"The material was horribly boring, but he actually made in enjoyable.  He has a great sense of humor.  He gives you every opportunity to do well."
20,4.0,2.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BILLINGS,"Great teacher!  Tests are all essay, but he grades them very fairly.  But bring a pillow on presentaion days, that's a bore!"
