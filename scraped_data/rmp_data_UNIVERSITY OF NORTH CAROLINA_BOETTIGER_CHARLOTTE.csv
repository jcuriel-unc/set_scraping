1,5.0,4.0, NSCI420,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLOTTE,BOETTIGER,"Dr Boettiger is far and away my favorite prof at UNC and NSCI420 is my favorite class. She's been fantastic at online classes and is super flexible, always asking for feedback. Her lectures are fantastic in my opinion, and though the class is pretty difficult, she's always open to help you and is so incredibly caring. Cannot recommend her enough!"
2,5.0,5.0, PSYC420,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLOTTE,BOETTIGER,"Dr. Boettiger is awesome and one of the best professors I've had at UNC. Her passion for neuroanatomy is inspiring and she articulates her grading policies very clearly, hardly ever deviating from the syllabus with regards to weekly quizzes and exams. Functional Neuroanatomy is a very tough course, however, and must be prioritized to succeed."
3,5.0,4.0, PSYC420,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLOTTE,BOETTIGER,Professor Boettiger is one of the best professors I've had so far at UNC. Neuroanatomy is a hard subject with an insane amount of material to cover but she teaches it really well. Every lecture is fascinating. Her tests and assignments are hard but she's very compassionate about grading and is always willing to adjust if the entire class does badly
4,3.5,5.0, PSYC220H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLOTTE,BOETTIGER,"She's really nice and funny, but the class was difficult. I have a passion for neuroscience, but I could only pull a B in this class because it was so hard. There's a lot of content so beware of that. Even though it's listed as a psych class, it has the amount of work and rigor as a science class (and it doesn't count for the neuroscience minor!)."
5,4.0,3.0, PSYC220H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLOTTE,BOETTIGER,"I loved this class. Boettiger is super into what she teaches and she makes it fun. Don't get me wrong, it's still biopsychology which is hard and sometimes a bit dry but she does a good job of allowing students to show what they've learned and get credit for it in tests and extra credit opportunities. She's super cool and experienced."
6,4.5,4.0, PSYC220H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLOTTE,BOETTIGER,"This class is pretty difficult due to the course material, but she is one of the best at explaining and answering questions. The class doesn't technically require attendance but there is an in class quiz every week that you have to be there for."
