1,1.0,4.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"She uses a flipped teaching method which should've been my first red flag. IMO, flipped teaching is an excuse for lazy professors to not do their jobs and then when you come to them struggling, they can blame it on you for ""not doing the reading"". The topic is especially difficult, you're made to teach it to yourself, and she's rude. Save yourself."
2,5.0,3.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"I took two classes with Professor Bassi and she is by far the best professor I have had at UNC. The game theory material is difficult but if you show up, pay attention, and engage, you will learn a lot and do well. She is so kind and cares about her students. Wish I could've taken more classes with her before I graduated."
3,5.0,3.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"Professor Bassi is amazing. Although tests do account for a significant portion of your grade, they are genuinely not difficult if you put effort into preparing for it. The assignments are made to be more difficult on purpose in order to better prepare you for the exam. Take a class with Professor Bassi, you will not regret it!"
4,1.0,3.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"This class is mostly teach yourself at home. The lectures did not always align with the content on the midterms/assignments. The class is comprised of assignments, midterms, and a final. The midterms and final make up the bulk of the grade. The teacher is however understanding with grades and may weigh better grades more heavily. "
5,5.0,3.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"This class is a mix, there are only 3 assignments and the final is 40%. The material is highly theoretical and sometimes counter intuitive, if you do not understand the concepts after the two weeks, drop it!! However, once you get over the learning curve it is a great class, do the extra practice and show up and you will be fine. 10/10 professor."
6,1.0,4.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"This class was possibly the worst I have taken at UNC. Your grade consists of 3 homeworks and 3 tests, with the weight of the tests being much more than the homework. The lectures are literally pictures of the textbook that she talks about (with no mic) in front of the class for the entire period. If you take this class, choose a different prof."
7,4.0,3.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"You have to practice a lot to do well since your grade is just three HWS and three tests. Really nice review videos, do the practice assignments and you'll be fine."
8,4.0,3.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,Very nice professor. Hws are really hard but if you watch her review videos and do practice problems an A is very attainable.
9,1.0,5.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"Lectures are long and are not interactive in any way. Content is difficult to grasp and asking questions during class is not easy. There are few grades in the gradebook, so if you don't do well on all of them you're screwed."
10,1.0,4.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"Entirely taught based on screenshots from the textbook. Discrepancies exist in teaching style between book and textbook however, making the course more confusing than it needs to be. Professor Bassi also spoke down to students, seemingly refused to answer question regarding homework and took access to the online lectures away days before the final."
11,5.0,3.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"If you show up to lectures and pay attention you'll be well prepared. The extra practice problems are much closer to the actual exams than the assignments, so definitely do them. She's extremely nice if you have any questions and is consistently available through email and office hours."
12,5.0,4.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"Professor Bassi is friendly, kind, understanding, and willing to meet outside of office hours for extra instruction or exam review. She's a fair grader and the tests aren't crazy hard if you study. Always do the extra practice problems (they're REALLY helpful! ) If you're willing to attend class and study, you'll do fine. If not, you won't pass."
13,1.0,4.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"As others from this semester have previously stated, the professor struggled to clearly teach the material of the class. You would probably be better off researching the topics outside of class. The final exam was nothing like how the midterm had been, in terms of difficulty, and covered topics not taught in class. Definitely avoid."
14,1.0,5.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,Def skip this class. Concepts are explained vaguely - students explained them better. No resources are provided to help study; you don't even get your midterm back besides the grade. Final was unreasonably hard and had topics not covered in class. Prof was unwilling to do anything even though most students failed the final which is 40% of grade
15,1.0,4.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"The professor poorly explained concepts (certain students did far better jobs explaining them), disregarded student concerns after their wifi cut out during exams, and gave a final that was shockingly more difficult than any of the assignments or midterm (average was 68, median was 65; 40% of grade). Most students had As until the final."
16,2.0,4.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"Professor Bassi taught this class, POLI 288, for the first time online this semester. It was not great. The material was not explained very well through the both asynch and synch classes, and reviews of assignments were always asynch. I P/F'd this class due to this lack of understanding of the material. Not a great professor, difficult material."
17,2.0,1.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"Went to class 4 times. First day, both exams, and to turn in an Extra Credit assignment. Got an A-. PowerPoints are online and the material is not difficult. Any amount of effort and you can get an A"
18,2.0,1.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"Dr. Bassi is incredibly knowledgable about the subject. Unfortunately, this is one of the most boring classes I have ever taken. It moves a snail slow pace. Luckily, it's also very easy. Anyone with any game theory knowledge can likely show up to all the classes and get an A/B without much effort. Also, she is almost always late."
19,5.0,2.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"Professor Bassi is just so accessible outside the class and she is not a tough grader at all. The material in the class is so fun if you are, like me, into game theory and voting system."
20,2.0,1.0, POLI288,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BASSI,"Tests were extremely easy, curve is very generous. This class is an easy A. Prof. Bassi a lovely person but a poor instructor; she shows up 5-10 minutes late almost every day, she makes you sign up for a timeslot to go to her office hours, and she was absent pretty frequently (and sent the TA to teach the class). Easy class, poor instruction."
