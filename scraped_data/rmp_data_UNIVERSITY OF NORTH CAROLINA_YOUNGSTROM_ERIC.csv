1,5.0,3.0, PSYC500,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,"Dr. Youngstrom is an incredibly professor. A lot of students complained about some of the assignments but he does everything for a reason. The assignments are meant to prepare you for graduate level work, but it wasn't too difficult. He's super funny (maybe a little awkward-funny at times) and really cares about his students."
2,5.0,3.0, PSYC500,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,"Dr. Y told us this would be taught like a graduate-level class, but definitely not. Very lecture-heavy. However, Dr. Y is a great lecturer! He's an incredibly funny professor (lots of in-class demonstrations of concepts) & is always available to answer questions. Did a great job transitioning to online. Bonus: Two quiz grades replaced by the final."
3,5.0,4.0, PSYC500,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,Dr. Y is AMAZING! He is the best professor I have had at UNC. He really cares about his students and you to succeed. It is possible to get an A if you work hard and show you are putting effort into the class.  I would highly recommend taking this class. His lectures are entertaining and he has you apply what you've learned to cases from his clinic.
4,5.0,4.0, PSYC500,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,"If you enjoy psychology at all, take any class you can with him! He definitely enjoys the material as well as wants to helps his students succeed. One of the best professors I've had at UNC."
5,4.5,2.0, 500,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,Great professor! Highly recommended for any psyc majors. Especially individuals considering graduate school
6,5.0,2.0, C829,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,HE IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!
7,4.0,4.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,"This class was horribly boring.  He tries to make it amusing but I constantly had to fight off sleep.  Nice guy though.  Approachable and always looking to help.  But if you prefer a structured environment, look elsewhere."
8,4.5,1.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,"Dr. Youngstrom was a great professor. I'm innately horrible at math, and with his help (his TA Andrew Freedman is really good too) I got an A in statistics! Always willing to help, and he obviously designs the class so you can get the highest grade possible. If you have to take PSYC 210, definitely take it with Youngstrom!"
9,4.5,1.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,"I took this class in summer session. It went fast. The professor tried to make stats interesting, did the best he could with the material. The TA does all the grading and was extremely strict. I disagree with the other student, when the TA made an error grading, he fixed it. The TA was extremely fair."
10,4.5,2.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,This dude is goofy as hell.  He does his best to makes statistics interesting.  Take his class if you get the chance.  You'll actually learn the material without being bored to tears.
11,4.5,1.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,"He did a great job of making this a good class.  The class itself is incredibly easy/boring, but he did an awesome job of giving engaging lectures.  He's a really nice guy.  I would definitely recommend him as a professor."
12,4.5,4.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,"Best Prof Ever! Makes Stats fun and very good at explaining. Recitations are not mandatory, but can be helpful. I totally recommend this class if you have to take psyc 210."
13,4.0,2.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,"Wonderful guy!!! He made stats painless, which was great since none of us wanted to be there. He also gave us a spreadsheet before the final that told us exactly what each of us needed on the final to get the next highest grade and the next highest etc up to an A, but I think there was a curve at the end too, which explains my solid A."
14,5.0,4.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ERIC,YOUNGSTROM,Dr. Youngstrom is one of the greatest professors I have ever had. He managed to make something as boring as statistics extremely fun! I would recommend this class to anyone who is a psychology major or who needs a statistics class!
