1,5.0,3.0, PSYC569,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KURT,GRAY,"Hands down one of my favorite professors and classes ever. He is so funny, personable and engaging and the material we cover is so interesting and applicable to life. I wish I could take 10 more classes with professor Gray!! Exams are pretty specific, but he gives extra credit. Not an easy A but you wont regret taking this class, 10/10 recommend"
2,5.0,3.0, PSYC569,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KURT,GRAY,"Dr. Gray is the best. He lectures every class but he actually is really engaging with his talks, I was never bored.  He is incredibly helpful and answers questions well. It was one of the best classes I've taken at Carolina and it was definitely because of Dr. Gray. His tests do have questions that you'd only know if you regularly came to class."
