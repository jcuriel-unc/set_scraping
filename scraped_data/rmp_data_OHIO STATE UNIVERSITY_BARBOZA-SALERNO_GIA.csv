1,5.0,4.0, PUBHHBP7542,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GIA,BARBOZA-SALERNO,"I loved this class with Gia. They are so enthusiastic and have so much experience to share. There is a good amount of reading that I struggled to keep up with but it rarely impacted my ability to participate. Participating in their class is so thought-provoking and you can really get a lot out of it. Gia will challenge you, and it rocks!"
2,5.0,4.0, PUBHHBP7542,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GIA,BARBOZA-SALERNO,"Gia is one of those professors I will never forget. Not only are they well educated in the topic they are lecturing on, but it is very apparent that they are passionate about it as well. Their lectures are very fast paced, but that just further illustrates that they love what they do. I would take them again in a heart beat!"
