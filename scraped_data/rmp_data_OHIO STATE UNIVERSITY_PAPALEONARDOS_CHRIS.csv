1,2.0,5.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"I took this class thinking it would be a normal asynchronous gen ed class, but Dr. P made the exams INCREDIBLY difficult, referencing exact quotes he made in 3 1/2+ hour lectures and readings and making the exams closed note. The average grades on midterm/final were below 65%, yet he refused to change anything when I addressed this issue. DONT TAKE"
2,1.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,This course is online and the overall workload is very easy. The midterms however are horrible and the timing is simply not fair. The study guides before the test are truly a waste of time and I would recommend the other online sociology teachers. I did not learn one thing. 
3,4.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"Dr. Papaleonardos' lectures were interesting, but sometimes dry or redundant. There was a lot of work to do, but it wasn't too difficult. I rented a textbook for this course which was helpful, but not entirely necessary (though there were a few quiz questions that asked for definitions from the textbook). "
4,1.0,4.0, SOC3597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"The study guides he gives are useless. Read the chapters and the papers he assigns. Also, the end of semester project is important so put all your energy into that, he is looking for ridiculous info especially in the paper.
Don't bother emailing him, he will take a pic of your email and post it to the discussion board and answer it that way."
5,2.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,This course had a TON of reading involved. (I read NONE of it and still did alright because of quizlet). The exams were very hard and you have to move fast. 
6,4.0,3.0, SOCIOL3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"Good professor, exams are very specific and cover ALL assigned materials, make sure you review them very carefully. Content is interesting and fun to engage with, so reviewing all the materials really isn't that bad an experience. Be prepared to set aside a good amount of time to really pay attention to the reading and videos and you'll be fine."
7,3.0,3.0, SOCIOL3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"Interesting content, not a bad professor imo. Course covers a lot of content, read/watch everything assigned bc. it will definitely appear on the exams. My advice: carefully rewatch each lecture before taking the test, majority of questions come from the video lectures. You need to know your stuff really well to do well, but it's not a bad class."
8,2.0,2.0, SOC236701H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"One of the slowest graders I have ever had at any level of schooling. I'll probably get an A in the class, but it's hard to say for sure, since over a quarter of our points are not in yet. He says that we are scored on participation, but did not know our names or take attendance until the last day. Incredibly easy grader, but a dry lecturer."
9,4.0,2.0, 236701H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"This class was dry but educational. The lectures were most interesting when he drew from personal experience, but overall were pretty generic. The books were well worth my time and I enjoyed reading/discussing them. He isn't a difficult grader so if you read the books and put some effort in you'll be fine. Make sure to take good notes in class."
10,2.0,4.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"The lectures are uncomfortable, I’m a social work major and found myself being offended by some of his material. Referred to women’s bodies in an uncomfortable manor. The course is easy overall, you don’t need to attend class to do okay on web assignments and mid term."
11,4.0,3.0, SOC236701H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"Assigns lots of reading and papers, which is to be expected from a second writing course. Lectures were usually dry but when he drew from his personal experience they improved. Very knowledgeable about politics and current events. Gives little feedback but did not grade too harshly. Most readings were engaging and applicable to modern times."
12,1.0,4.0, SOCIOL395701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"Instructor hardly teaches anything, assigns random readings each week, no lectures. Clearly professor has no interest in the course, only posted 5-10 minute videos on topics each week, everything else is self taught. Exams are nearly impossible, none of the questions are taken from the textbook, or topics covered. Prof doesn't responds to emails."
13,1.0,4.0, SOCIOL395701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,Please do not have this professor at all if you don't have to. ESPECIALLY if the class is online. He is extremely non-communicative. This class was just 3 months of reading hundreds of pages of a textbook and trying to regurgitate the information on exams. Consider eating an entire plastic dollhouse before taking a course with him.
14,1.0,5.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"Chris Papaleonardos is by far the WORST professor I have ever had the misfortune of having. I watched lecture, I read the readings, I did the homework, I studied for exams and still ended in B. I was a sophomore engineering major and this has been the lowest grade and hardest class I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE."
15,4.0,2.0, SOCIOL3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"I think there are so many negative responses just because the midterm and final ask some very specific questions about the readings and lectures rather than ""big picture"" stuff, but people don't like to pay attention or read much for gen eds. All the assignments (including the one essay) are graded very easily and aren't difficult."
16,2.0,5.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,Lots of stupid time consuming readings that you had to do because he asked specific questions about them on tests. Makes you listen to his sociology podcast instead of making lectures. You have to do all the work for learning this material and he is of zero use.
17,3.0,1.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,I never watched lectures and assignments were easy. Tests use a lockdown browser so you do have to do your reading. Tests are honestly harder than you would think and his grading is so weird. My friends and I would get different scores even with similar answers (discussed after the fact). He did round my grade without me asking. Feedback was bad.
18,1.0,4.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"The exams are unreasonable for the content he offers. As a junior in engineering, this is the worst grade I have received in any class."
19,1.0,4.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"Just took his final: if you think you know the content-you don't. Studied and did majority of readings/lectures, still bombed it. Asynchronous is a horrible decision for the amount of readings and extra crap he has. Exams are super hard, study guides are minimal help. Only positive is discussion boards and assignments aren't too difficult."
20,1.0,5.0, SOCIOL395701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,PAPALEONARDOS,"This online class had very little actual teaching. I suspect he still tested on what he has previously taught in class. Study guides are useless, exams are ridiculously hard with 45 minutes for 50 complex questions. There is no time for those who have trouble reading/processing quickly in a testing environment & goal seems to be to reduce grades."
