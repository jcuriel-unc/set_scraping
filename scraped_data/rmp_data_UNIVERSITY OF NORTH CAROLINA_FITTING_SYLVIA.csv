1,5.0,2.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SYLVIA,FITTING,"She is such an amazing and caring professor! The tests are very straightforward and from the lectures and she gives study guides. The quizzes are very easy from the textbook and there are 4 papers that she grades very easily. She gives extra credit on the tests. Honestly, the best professor I've ever had. I loved her the sweetest. "
2,5.0,2.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SYLVIA,FITTING,Professor Fitting is very helpful in her office hours and open to students to share their opinions. This class is a lot of memorization but is easy when you get the hang of it. Take Professor Fitting!! 
3,5.0,3.0, PSYC220H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SYLVIA,FITTING,"Dr. Fitting is the sweetest professor ever. There are 16 quizzes based on the readings (the lowest one is dropped), 5 papers, 3 midterms, and 1 final exam. Dr. Fitting saw that I struggled on the second midterm and provided review sessions to me that helped me to do drastically better on the third midterm. She wants you to do the best in her class!"

6,5.0,2.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SYLVIA,FITTING,"6 papers 4 tests but not as intimidating as it seems. Lowest test is dropped and paper can be extra credit. Very clear grading criteria. Show up, work hard, get an A, move on! She's very accessible outside of class and offers a lot of help to aid your success."
7,4.0,3.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SYLVIA,FITTING,"Dr. Fitting's class is boring but exams are straight memorization and are solely on her PowerPoints (can drop 1 exam). She basically reads off the PowerPoint for the entire class every single day. Only hw is 6 short papers (drops 1) based off the PowerPoints. Definitely have to study for tests, but if you can memorize/ repeat well, you'll do fine."
8,4.0,3.0, PSYC290,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SYLVIA,FITTING,"Dr. Fitting is awesome I really enjoyed her class, I also learned a lot. I would recommend taking her for sure. I did pretty well on all of her tests, her Power Points are super useful and great for testing material. I loved the papers, fair, and way better than quizzes. One of my favorite classes."
9,4.0,3.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SYLVIA,FITTING,"Dr. Fitting is a pretty good teacher though her English is a little off since she's from Germany. I learned a lot from this course and did great on the first exam but poorly on the last 2 b/c she said ""I made the tests more difficult so ppl would come to class."" You have to do 10 400 word papers for the semester which aren't bad at all."
