1,5.0,2.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"Penn was great. Tried to make it the best he could as an 8am. Exams worth 80% of grade and you get to drop 1 (not the final).  5 papers (20% of grade)- 1 gets dropped. If you do the study guide for the exams and know it you will do good on the tests. Papers had clear criteria and were only 2 pages long, I did them the day b4 it was due and got 100s"
2,5.0,2.0, PSCY101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"I loved being Taught by Professor/Dr. Penn! I had him at 8:00 AM and his class always woke me up in the mornings. He would play videos before class to help wake us up. Also, he would mention sometimes which things would and wouldn't be included in an exam. He had 4 exams, including a final, and 5 papers which made up our whole class grade. "
3,2.0,4.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"He's a great guy and he definitely has the intelligence and oratory prowess to impress. That said, I do agree that this 101 class is far too focused on deeper neuroscience/biological psych. That's what makes the class harder than appears. The lecture-heaviness isn't that bad; the slides are always uploaded online for study or if you miss class."
4,5.0,3.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"Dr. Penn is an all around great professor, his tests are primarily composed of content he covers in his lectures so it's very important to attend the actual classes. This never really feels like a chore though because his lectures are always very engaging and he provides practical real-world situations in which the topics discussed are relevant."
5,1.0,4.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"Penn is a kind and understanding man but not the best professor for PSYC101. The material barely focused on actual psychology but was about topics that didn't seem relevant. The exams HEAVILY rewarded attendance, be sure to take notes about every aspect of what is mentioned during the lectures. Only 3 essays and 4 exams were graded."
6,5.0,2.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"Dr. Penn lectures heavy but the content is interesting and he uses lots of videos and tells stories for examples. The essays he gives are short and simple. The hardest part are the tests, but if you study you should pass them. Attendance is via Polleverywhere but if you miss class you miss important material that's missing from ppt."
7,4.0,2.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"Dr. Penn is a great guy. If you want to make an A in this class, write down literally everything he says in lecture and then study your notes. You do not need the textbook at all. He also gave 2 extra credit opportunities and that helped me get an A. The only work you do outside of class is an occasional 2 page essay and studying before a test!"
8,3.0,4.0, PSYCH101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"David Penn is a great guy, but for psych 101 you're probably better off taking another prof for psych 101. I even feel bad saying that because he's genuinely DT earth and cares about his students, but the tests are very lecture based and there were writing assignments that are graded pretty harshly. If you do take this class, write down EVERYTHING."
9,5.0,3.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"I LOVE DR. PENN. Went into this class not knowing what to expect, & now I'm ending the class as a Psychology major. His class is lecture heavy, but he makes them interesting. He genuinely cares about his students and wants to see them succeed. He is one of the kindest professors I have had! Lecture mandatory depending on when he takes attendance."
10,1.0,3.0, GEB3031,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,Horrible communication and does not know how to use email or in-class technology
11,3.0,2.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"I think Dr. Penn is a very nice and kind man. However, I find his lectures fairly boring which sucks, because his exams are solely based on lecture and very miniscule details. I didn't find the class necessarily hard, but I didn't enjoy it and had very low motivation to study the material."
12,5.0,2.0, PSCY101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"David is literally amazing. He is so nice and everything that he talks about in lecture, is exactly how it will be on the exam. The videos that he shows in class are humorous, and the real life scenarios that he provides are helpful. As long as you study, the exams will go well. I definitely recommend taking a class with him."
13,5.0,3.0, PSCY101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,Best professor I've had. This man's lecture gets straight to the point and he clarifies a lot of the material. He is very funny and enthusiastic about psychology. Exams are challenging so I suggest recording lectures and going through his slides. There are few papers and participation is important. Textbook is NEVER used. Put in the work for an A
14,2.0,3.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"Lectures were so boring, it was hard to stay awake through them. Didn't seem into the 101 class and was only really enthusiastic when we covered schizophrenia (which is his field of expertise). Participation is from PollEverywheres each day and he drops 10% of the lowest grades so you can still get a good attendance grade if you skip sometimes."
15,5.0,2.0, PSCY101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"Dr. Penn is good professor for teaching a 400 person lecture class. He tries to be funny and most times hes successful. Genuine, great guy who loves psych and makes the class enjoyable."
16,5.0,3.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"I love D. Penn! He is very caring of all the students in the class; he tries to remember all the names and associate them with faces. His teaching style also allows people to understand information better. He uses a lot of examples, videos, and class experiments to demonstrate concepts, and it really helps with actually understanding concepts."
17,5.0,3.0, PSCY101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"D. Penn is such a kind guy. He is super understanding and does everything in his power to make the class easy to understand. If you dedicate the time to the material, you will get a high grade. He drops the lowest test, paper, and 10% of attendance. Super caring and likable. Would highly recommend."
18,5.0,2.0, PSYCH101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"Not a hard class and not hard to get a good grade (A/A-/B+), especially if you go to the class. The tests are EXACTLY from the class, and not at all from the textbook. He tries to learn everyone's name even in a large lecture hall. Really nice guy, and cool prof. 5 writing assign which were tougher reading material than expected, not too hard tho."
19,5.0,2.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"Love my man DP. best part about this class is that he refers to students as ""gang."" tests are harder than expected but take good notes and you should get an A."
20,4.5,1.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DAVID,PENN,"Loved this class! It is definitely an easy A. There are 5 short papers, 3 exams, and 1 final. You can drop the lowest grade for the papers and exams. Lectures are long but interesting. He likes to test people on the videos/examples/demonstrations, so take notes during those. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK. It is a huge waste of your money."
