1,5.0,1.0, PYSCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DYLAN,WAGNER,"I loved this class! Ben was nice, helpful, and very approachable.  I had him freshman year and it was nice to have a friendly and reassuring professor.  The material was interesting, and easy to follow.  My only complaint would be that sometimes class moved too slow and I would get bored, but for a freshman honors course that's not a bad thing."
2,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DYLAN,WAGNER,"I had Dr. Wagner for honors psychology my freshman year and he was great. I was worried that an honors course would be too much work, but he just made the class much more discussion based and really got to know you on a personal level. I would recommend him in a heartbeat! Take his class, you won't regret it!"
3,4.5,3.0, PSYCH2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DYLAN,WAGNER,"I loved attending this class. He made the material really interesting, and easy to understand. He's probably one of the best professors i've ever had. There's no point in buying the book, everything is in the slides. I would definitely recommend him!"
4,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DYLAN,WAGNER,One of the best teachers I could have hoped for for my freshman year. Had him for Intro to Psych Honors and he was wonderful - always concerned about what he could do to help us. The entire class loved him. Made learning the material so fun by doing interactive things with the class and watching movies. If you try in the class you'll be fine.
5,4.5,2.0, PSYCH367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DYLAN,WAGNER,"Gives good notes and does an excellent job of teaching. The only thing that makes the papers difficult is attempting to fit everything you need into two pages. Holds a review session before each exam and is always willing to help. As long as you pay attention in class, you'll be fine."
6,5.0,4.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DYLAN,WAGNER,"the class is ridiculous for a gec. we have 5 2 page papers and a revised paper which is paper 6. and 2 midterms and a final so you have something due every single week. it requires more effort to pass then major classes. the study guides for the exams are 3.5 pages long. he means well, but i wouldnt take it again, or recommend it."
