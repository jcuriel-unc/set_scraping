1,2.0,4.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DELWIN,LINDSEY,The professor himself is extremely nice and understanding but the lectures do very little to help you on the exams. Majority of the time the exams and tests have material in them that we havent covered yet. He can put you to sleep quickly if you aren't zeroed in on his powerpoints. 
2,3.0,5.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DELWIN,LINDSEY,Lectures were really convoluted & hard to understand. Textbook was really hard to read and comprehend. All tests were obviously written by him & they were extremely wordy and confusing and over stuff we never talked ab but may have been mentioned once in all 5 chapters of that section in text. Really rude in email &usually didnt respond for hours
3,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DELWIN,LINDSEY,"He is a tough teacher as he has weekly assignments, but their weight is practically nothing to the exams. No quizzes. The book is CHURCH in this class, so you need to get it. His lectures are important so take your best notes. He hardly responds to emails. His study guides dont match up with his tests nor the material sometimes. Good luck."
4,5.0,5.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DELWIN,LINDSEY,I worked HARD for the B I got in this class. His tests were difficult but he graded leniently with a curve and offered us the option of a take home final. Its not an easy class but he really knows his stuff.
5,2.0,4.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DELWIN,LINDSEY,The only teacher I've ever had that would treat questions like they were stupid. Ignored emails.
6,4.0,3.0, PSYCH313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DELWIN,LINDSEY,"Class discussions are very fun/interesting and you learn a lot during them. Lecture style can get boring. The only thing that bothered me is that he didn't seem organized. He took a long time to get things up on carmen and then he didn't even pass back our exams so we could see what we got wrong. Nevertheless, he's a great guy and a decent prof."
7,1.5,5.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DELWIN,LINDSEY,This class was terrible and boring. It was absolutely impossible to get a good score on tests. They had hardly any relevance to the lecture and pretty much everyone in my class failed tests. My class average for tests taken was a 67%. it was impossible to get an A and very difficult to get even a B. Don't take this class if you want a good GPA.
8,2.0,4.0, PSY100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DELWIN,LINDSEY,Delwin Lindsey is a horrible teacher.  His class doesn't help you.  He doesn't help you.  His powerpoints don't help you on exams.  His exams barely relate to what he says.  Do NOT take Psych 100 with him and do NOT take Psych 100HE with him because he will just drown you with the most useless junk in the world.
