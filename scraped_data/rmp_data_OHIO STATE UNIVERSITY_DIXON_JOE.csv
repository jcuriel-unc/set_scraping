1,1.0,4.0, SOC4506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,Most boring lecturer ever. Super hard grader. Takes off points for almost no reason and then will not discuss it with the student. The class consists of 3 total grades. He doesn't respond to emails or takes forever to respond. Most of the exam answers were found in the readings that are posted. Take this if you want to hurt your GPA. 
2,4.0,3.0, SOC4506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"the other reviews are harsh, Dr. Dixon is a great professor! Make sure you read the syllabus, there is an opportunity for extra credit. There are are only 2 assignments and 2 exams and also lots of opportunity for extra credit."
3,1.0,5.0, SOC4506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,Hands down one of the worst professors I have ever had at this school. He looks for oddly specific answers for exams and papers and if your answers don't align exactly with what he has in mind you won't receive points. He doesn't seem to care about the fact that the majority of the class is doing poorly. Also has very few grades in the grade book.
4,1.0,2.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"Lazy opinion based rants with little objective fact and no dialogue.

Rants include: ""Why we should allow child s** dolls for pedophiles,"" ""Why cars should be abolished,"" and ""Why Apple is not innovative.""

If you want to learn anthropology, buy a textbook and form your own based opinion. I love anthropology, but this class was so disappointing."
5,1.0,2.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"Guy was a complete tool. Lectures felt like they went on for an eternity, full of cool little zingers that Im sure Joe thinks are mad clever, guaranteed to make your eyes roll so fast into your head that you'll fall out of your chair. Basically stopped showing up to class, still did fine but don't recommend if you can avoid him."
6,2.0,3.0, SOC4506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,There were only 3 assignments in the course. Took the entire semester to grade 1out of the 3 assignments.  Second grade was automatically generated from one of the 2 exams. This  class was extremely  stressful.
7,1.0,5.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,Worst professor I have had at this school yet and for a GENERAL EDUCATION CLASS. He is grossly ignorant and operates on his own schedule. Had covid at the beginning of the semester and had to email him 4 times before I received the content I missed. Words his questions unfairly that answers are opinion based but he does not agree with anyone.
8,1.0,5.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! This class had unneeded stress. He is pretentious yet ill-informed. I think they thought he was smart based on his accent but he scammed them. He made up rubrics after the fact and left little feedback that is unhelpful and seems to not make sense. He definitely skimmed them. Highest grades on the two main papers were low A's
9,1.0,3.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"Joe Dixon is an incompetent wanking mess. If his unbelievable pretentiousness doesn't turn you off then the outrageous grading system and constant yawning probably will. Will not reply to emails from students despite the lack of a TA, has only remedial knowledge of the subject being taught. Overall a huge waste of time."
10,1.0,4.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"Grossly incompetent, what more is there to say? Takes the class way too seriously, grades off an imaginary rubric of what he likes or doesn't. Pretentious, and I had difficulty writing the way he liked even though I have been told I have been the best writer in classes before and took a writing class at the same time where I had a high A."
11,1.0,4.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"He seems to be nice but he is a terrible professor. The lectures are interesting, but unhelpful. He does not treat it like the throwaway, participation grade class he should treat it as. The rubrics are vague and has lengthy grading making feedback unhelpful. Grades are harsh and illogical. He doesn't know good writing. He should change or be fired"
12,1.0,3.0, SOCIOL3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"Vague grading rubric, boring and un-interactive lectures, lectures do not cover any material that is on assignments. In my case, feedback was not given until the second last week of school and did not allow the students, including I, to correct course and work off of the given feedback. This has left most students feeling helpless and withbadgrades"
13,1.0,4.0, SOCIOL3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"My main problem with this professor was that he waited until the second to last week before exams before grading one of our reading summaries, of which we had every other week since week 5, and proceed to give feedback that would have be helpful if we had another one to do. The grades on these assignments were also very harsh"
14,1.0,3.0, SOC4506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"The material was interesting but it would have been better if Professor Dixon were better versed in it. He often would present information to the class that was inaccurate, sometimes multiple times a class. He also added two discussion assignments a week when classes switched to at a distance at the start of covid, which was overwhelming."
15,4.0,4.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"Professor Dixon himself is a fine professor, has some charming jokes in class and is nice. My biggest complaint is that he is a fairly difficult grader and his rubrics are very vague. He will call you out in class if you're being rude and talking, but lectures do not really have much to do with your work outside of class and are interesting."
16,1.0,3.0, SOC4506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"Took one of his classes thinking it would be about something I enjoy, turned out to be completely different. Would never take him again."
17,1.0,5.0, SOC4506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"I'm in this class right now. Lots of complaints: The worst lecturer I've ever had. Doesn't seem like he knows the content he's trying to teach, just stands behind the computer screen and mumbles off his notes, looking down the entire time. Absolutely no class discussions. Exam was nothing he said it would be and much of it he never discussed."
18,1.0,5.0, SOC4506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"I am still in this class, but this class is SO dry. He does not know what he is talking about half of the time."
19,1.0,5.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN. There is essentially no grading criteria, and even if you follow assignment guidelines perfectly, he will find ways to lower your grade. One of the best gpa droppers out there."
20,4.0,3.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOE,DIXON,"I liked him a lot. While attendance is mandatory (miss more than 4 classes and you get docked a letter grade), he kept the classes very interesting and insightful. He is a very nice guy to talk to and gives good feedback on your papers. Take into account his feedback on your Op-Ed, incorporate it into your discussion paper, and you will be good."
