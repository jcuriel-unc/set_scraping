1,4.5,4.0, POLITSC4212,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,Awesome if challenging professor!
2,4.5,2.0, INTSTDS3350,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,Awesome professor. Studied at some University called Cambridge? He adds like 20 points onto everyones quizzes and as long as you read the book  theyre easy. If you like history then take this class
3,1.0,5.0, INTSD3350,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,This class is WAY too difficult for a GEC. I don't know what he expects and he is not clear AT ALL when giving lectures. The notes he gives online are also not very good. I would not recommend taking this course with this particular professor unless you already have a good background of Western Europe.
4,1.5,4.0, POLSC3350,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"Quizzes are unbelievably hard. A LOT of reliance on the book. (You have to read like 100 pages a week) Quizzes don't pertain to lecture. Exams are easier, one essay based on lecture and a few short answer questions. He's not very clear and has an EXTRAVAGANT vocabulary that is hard to understand. This class is TOO hard to be a GEC."
5,5.0,3.0, INTSD210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,He is incredibly intelligent and international studies 210 was the epitome of a liberal arts education.
6,3.0,5.0, INSTD210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,His exams are very difficult; for a GEC this class is WAY too hard.
7,2.5,5.0, POL612,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"Thinks he's above students, boring, lets his TA do the work, the paper and exams were tough and harshly graded. I go out of my way to not take his classes. On the positive side he knows his stuff."
8,3.0,5.0, INTST210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"This class was way too hard for a GEC 210 level class.  Don't take it! I didn't trust the other comments that warned not to take it and had to learn the hard way that this class sucks.  He is a great professor, full of information, but he gives you no direction on what you need to look over.  I went to every lecture and was still completely lost."
9,4.5,4.0, POLSC532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,There is a lot of information. I had 50 written pages of notes for each of the midterm and final. There is also a final paper. The grading scale was nice
10,3.5,5.0, IS210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"far too in-depth for a 200 level class. The readings were long, not discussed, and not chronologically relevant to the day's lecture. The man is brilliant, but he expects you to be also in how he constructs his test questions. Tons of material overall. Avoid."
11,5.0,1.0, PS535,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"Prof. Gunther is an expert on modern democracies (particularly regarding southern Europe), and his enthusiasm for the subject made his class very fun.  I learned a lot about modern democracies."
12,3.5,5.0, INTSD210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"Juggernaut of information to absorb, even with the online Study Guides.  Brilliant man.  Go to every class, sit in front, record his lecture, and listen to them while munching on some chips.  And go to the operas and orchestras for 6% extra credit."
13,4.5,3.0, PS545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"His energy of strong interest in the subject matter is highly contagious. Relates themes well to real world change. Taking notes is a strong requirement for success on the quizzes and exams, the latter having above average difficulty. Solid Five Star Recommend."
14,3.5,5.0, IS210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"Professor Gunther knows what he is talking about. Mostly all of his info was recited from memory, very passionate making him interesting to listen to. The class is difficult though. Pop quizzes are tough, Essay midterm wasn't bad. Prepare for tons of reading. Not an easy class."
15,4.5,3.0, IS210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"This man is unbelievably smart.  I've learned so much from him.  If you are looking for an easy A, try something else, but if you want to actually learn something, IS 210 is a great class."
16,4.5,3.0, POL535,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,A fantastic lecturer.  I now go out of my way to find what class he teaches so that I can schedule it.  My favorite professor at OSU.
17,5.0,2.0, PLSC535,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"The level of knowledge Dr. Gunther has regarding democracies around the world is intimidating; nearly all of his statistics are recited from memory. What I assumed would be a dull class turned into one of my favorites, all due to Gunther. I'd take another class with him in a heartbeat."
18,4.5,2.0, POSCI535,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"Dr. Gunther made what could of been a dull class fairly interesting. The tests were essay, but they were over lecture material and not very difficult. The reading is very dull, but it is not very essential for the tests. Long term paper."
19,4.5,2.0, IS210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"He's passionate and lecture isn't bad, but he goes off on tangents sometimes. Slides are poor and bare minimum.  Midterm and final were cake, but the quizzes are a bit difficult and worth 100 points!  A paper of five pages is only worth 10 points, though....?"
20,2.0,4.0, INTST210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,GUNTHER,"Hard class (especially for an intro, 200-level class), I don't recommend it unless you're looking for a challenge. Prof is very smart but dry, and digresses a lot. Text readings are long and became unnecessary. 3 pop quizzes, a 5 page paper, midterm (mostly essay), & final (mostly essay). Honestly I'm just reallllly happy that this class is over."
