1,4.0,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,ROBINSON,"Fantastic professor. I took the OPEEP Psych 1100 class and although it was somewhat disorganized at times, he always made sure the students were taken care of and made sure that they have the ability to succeed. Very caring professor and a very humble person. Readings were very heavy at times, however they became easier to manage over time"
2,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,ROBINSON,"Dr. Robinson is very invested in your success. He could be driving, eating, or sleeping but he will still take the time to answer your question. It is an easy A if you follow his instructions which are clear. The course is also very organized."
3,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,ROBINSON,Amazing professor!!! all that needs to be said
4,4.0,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,ROBINSON,Dr. Robinson is a solid professor. Can be a bit of a boring lecturer but hes happy to discuss subjects with you and is interested in teaching. Hell tell you you dont need the book to pass but that youll need it if you want an A which is definitely true. Lots of extra credit and he posts all of his lecture notes before class.
5,4.0,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,ROBINSON,I cant begin to explain how much this professor cares about how his students are doing in the class and how much they ENJOY the class. He constantly is looking for feedback on how he can further change the course so that it can help our intro psych experience. There is extra credit literally every week and going to tutoring gets you extra credit!
6,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,ROBINSON,"Dr. Robinson gives out extra credit like candy on Halloween. This semester, he gave out 70 points of extra credit out of 500 total points, so if you get all of the EC and try in the class, you are well underway for an A in the class."
7,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,ROBINSON,"Makes the material enjoyable to learn and easy to understand. Really sweet and caring. Totally accommodating to the students. Posts his lectures on Carmen. Gives a lot of extra credit so if you don't do well it's on you. Professor aside, he's really such a great guy and I'd strongly suggest taking him. Also, don't buy the textbook bc its useless."
8,4.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,ROBINSON,"Professor Robinson actually genuinely cares about you. He will make time for one-on-one study sessions and offers TONS of extra credit. The material itself is challenging, but with the EC, you'll pass with flying colors. The only downside is that he spends a lot of time pushing his political agenda in class. All things considered, I recommend him."
9,4.5,2.0, 101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,ROBINSON,Tests are straightforward. Lot's of extra credit. Don't really need a textbook and there is no online stuff which is awesome. His study sessions saved my butt and is a really nice guy and is very lenient on grading.
10,3.0,4.0, 1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,ROBINSON,"Boring, not necessarily hard. just really boring "
