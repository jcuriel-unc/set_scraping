1,5.0,4.0, 4138,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Professor Baum was amazing. If you are seriously considering law school, I definitely recommend taking one of his classes. The entire class is very lecture and exam heavy, but if you truly engage in class and with the material, you will do just fine. I learned more in this class than I learned in any other political science classes combined."
2,5.0,4.0, 43136,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,Lawrence is a great guy and the best professor in this department. I have taken his two classes and I can say they will humble you. Not an easy A at all. Go for every class and write down every word he says. Highly recommend if you see law school in your future. It is very likely you will not get an A in this class. If that matters to you skip this
3,5.0,4.0, 4132H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Great guy. Loved 4136 with him, so I took this class. Anyone with any interest in the Supreme Court should take him; you will learn so much. This class wasn't as good; I'd already learned about a lot of material in his other course. Still valuable research and writing skills. He provides copious guidelines for the paper. Do that and you'll be ok."
4,5.0,5.0, 4132H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"This is one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken. While the class is very difficult (beware if you just want a grade booster), he is really passionate about the subject and I learned a lot more about the Supreme Court. The papers are long and difficult to write (20 page final paper), but it will turn out alright if you put in the work!"
5,5.0,3.0, 43136,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"If you have a chance to take a class with Dr. Baum. Do it. He is incredibly kind and cares so much for his students. Any and all of your questions will be answered in depth and he is very accommodating. The content can be a lot but if you follow the syllabus, you'll be fine"
6,5.0,4.0, 4132H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Dr. Baum is a fantastic professor. The final paper is long, but you will build up to it in your other two papers. By the end of the class you will have a comprehensive understanding of the court and a paper as a reference for your writing abilities. He does his best to connect with all students. I highly suggest taking even if you are not honors."
7,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4138,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"By far one of my favorite professors at OSU. His class had challenging material, but none of the assignments or exams are extremely difficult and he is great about implementing feedback. He also gave an easy extra credit assignment. I wish I had taken more classes with him while at OSU."
8,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4136,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,My favorite class I've ever taken was the one I took with him. He doesn't take attendance (though he notices those who show up) but GO TO CLASS. He's a great lecturer and if you know your lectures and cases you'll be fine . Sit towards the front to be one of Larry's favorites. You'll just want him to like you. It'll just make you feel good.
9,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4136,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Dr. Baum was incredible, a 6/5. He always assumed he explained something wrong instead of getting mad at students for not understanding, he let us be curious without letting ""poli sci kids"" pull us off on a tangent, and he pulled from current events to teach material. The class was tough, lecture-heavy, and lots of reading for sure, but worth it."
10,4.0,3.0, POLSCI4136,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,Dr. Baum is my favorite professor I have had so far at OSU. He cares so much for his students and is very passionate about the content he teaches. This class is tough but he works with you and makes sure that you learn. Although I received a B I believe I learned more in his course than any of the others I took this term.
11,5.0,4.0, 4132H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Professor Baum is one of the most kind, helpful professors I have ever had. The class is comprised of just three essays. They are 5, 10, and 20 pages and the 20 page is worth 70% of your grade. It seems intimidating, but he prepares you really well to do it and you will learn a ton. No attendance, but if you miss class you're screwed for the essays"
12,5.0,5.0, PLISCI4136,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Prof. Baum is the best professor Ive ever had at OSU as far as what I learned in the class  but the class was not easy! I loved the content, but there were only 3 exams, completely essay-based and timed. I had to rewatch lectures several times to get all the information at times. It was tough, but worth it. I feel like I know so much more now!"
13,2.0,5.0, POLITSC4136,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Professor Baum is a fantastic instructor but also an incredibly tough grader. Class is made up entirely of exams, so don't fail any because otherwise, you'll fail the course. He also offers little to no extra credit, so don't forget to prep for exams because they're your only source of redemption."
14,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4138,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Dr. Baum is one of the most kind and caring professors I've had at OSU. He does not use lecture slides, which is an adjustment at first, but is very engaging in class. His course was no cakewalk and the material bordered on dull at times, but it wasn't bad if you pay attention and study for exams."
15,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4138,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Dr. Baum is one of the best professors at OSU. Truly one of the nicest, most knowledgeable, and helpful professors I've had. Not an easy A but wont make you cry yourself to sleep. Not an overwhelming amount of work but covers a lot of material. He does not use any notes and lecture is completely oral, which is an adjustment but helped me focus."
16,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4136,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Baum is one of my favorite professors at OSU because he cares a lot about his students. I learned a lot in this course, and not just surface-level content but a deeper understanding of the Supreme Court. I recommend recording lectures because while they are engaging, they are long, and they are pretty much your only source of class content."
17,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4138,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Professor Baum's class isn't ""easy"" but you will learn a lot. I truly feel lucky to have been able to take 2 classes with him. You won't meet a professor at OSU that's more knowledgeable, kind, and caring. And he's hilarious."
18,2.0,4.0, POLITSC4138,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"He does not use any kind of slides or another presentation tool in class, he talks at you for 1:20 straight. This class was also graded solely on exams, which is not something I enjoy. I found recording the lectures to be somewhat helpful, but overall was not a fan of him at all. He is also confusing, sometimes going back on what he said before."
19,5.0,4.0, 4132H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Professor Baum was likely the most knowledgable and accessible professor I've had. The class was comprised of 3 papers, all research-based. However, you're given the time and resources to get it done, and he is there every step of the way to help. I wish I had another class with him because he is one of the kindest and smartest professors I've had."
20,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4138,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAWRENCE,BAUM,"Lawrence Baum might be the best professor I've had at OSU. While the class is totally lecture based, the way he presents the material is so interesting and you can tell how much he knows and loves what he does. I would suggest studying early because if you do the topic guides and know them well, you'll be fine on the exams!"
