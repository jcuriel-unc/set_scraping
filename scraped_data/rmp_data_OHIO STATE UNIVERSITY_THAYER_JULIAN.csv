2,2.0,5.0, HLTHPSYC,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIAN,THAYER,"He travelled to Sweden or Germany or somewhere practically every week. Always had someone guest lecture and tests did not come from anywhere! would not recommend this, though he is an interesting speaker."
3,2.0,5.0, PSYCH530,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIAN,THAYER,"The material is interesting.  However, he did not test over what he taught in class.  He also did not test over the book.  He admitted at the end of the quarter that he didn't even write his own tests.  The grades were so bad he wouldn't even post the averages."
