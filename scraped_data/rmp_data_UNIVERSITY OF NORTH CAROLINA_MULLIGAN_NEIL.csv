1,5.0,4.0, PSYCHLAW,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"Prof Mulligan's PSYC601 course was very lecture and reading heavy. You are graded on very few things- 3 exams, a couple of discussion forums, and a couple research article question assignments. "
2,4.0,3.0, PSYC430,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"I took PSYC430 as an async remote class and thought it was great. Even though Prof. Mulligan can be a dry and slow lecturer, lectures are prerecorded and can be sped up. I barely read the textbook, but did have to read journal articles to complete homework assignments. Graded by few things, but he's straightforward about exam structure."
3,4.0,3.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"I took PSYC 430! Nice guy, but dry lectures. Don't take if you aren't into classes where you have to take notes the whole time. The material we learned was interesting, so it wasn't that awful! I never opened my text book once, but did have to read articles in order to answer HW. Everything on exam was covered in class! Easy grader if you tried."
4,2.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"Dr. Mulligan is such a great person and very helpful when you reach out to him, but this class was HORRIBLE. The material was dry, the lectures were almost unbearable, the tests were ridiculously specific and hard (a, b, c, a and b, b and c,all of the above :/), and the grading criteria was so subjective with zero feedback. If you can avoid, pls do"
5,1.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,Extremely boring lectures in which he manages 75 minutes so poorly that half the material on our tests was never discussed in class. Tests are poorly made with extremely difficult answer choices. The paper assignment is graded very harshly with absolutely no feedback. The only truly bad psych prof I've had at UNC.
6,1.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,Literally worst class I have ever taken here at UNC. The lectures are ridiculously boring and he talks about smaller aspects of the course material for way too long. He's not engaging and talks for the entire 75 mins of class without asking any questions or allowing us to discuss. The tests ask questions that are so specific and not important.
7,1.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"There were 3 tests and one of them was scheduled right after a spring break!!!!???!??!??! The final is cumulative and all tests together are worth 80% of your overall grade so there is absolutely NO ROOM for error. Very boring lectures, so sitting for 75 minutes without getting distracted was sometimes impossible. Avoid Dr Mulligan at all costs!!!"
8,3.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"If you don't attend the lectures, you won't pass. The majority of the tests are made up of what was discussed in class (80% lecture based, 20% textbook based). Lectures are extremely boring but you need to listen and take good notes. Grades for this class include in-class quizzes, in-class writing assignments, one paper, three midterms, and a final"
9,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"I had Dr. Mulligan for PSYC 210, which is basically statistics. He's a really great lecturer; he repeats himself and does a bunch of examples on the board to make sure the material is clear. The textbook is essential, since you have homework out of it often. Overall, I thought the class was reasonable and I would recommend it to others."
10,5.0,3.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"Professor Mulligan is an amazing professor. I had him for PSYC 210 and 230, and I am planning on taking 430 with him. He provides many examples during his lectures to help students grasp concepts, and he also adds some humor. Most of the material on the exams come from his lectures; however, a few questions are pulled from the assigned readings."
11,5.0,3.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"Dr. Mulligan makes the material much more interesting by giving us experiments corresponding to the cogntive concepts discussed in the textbook. The tests focus A LOT more on what we covered in class and knowing textbook concepts is definitely secondary. Overall he's a very nice, clear, and helpful prof but at 8am the lectures can get boring."
12,4.0,3.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,Definitely knowledgeable and willing to help. Lectures can be boring (especially at 8 am) but he can be humorous.
13,4.0,3.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"Pretty knowledgeable professor and generally a nice guy. I suggest taking notes on your computer because he can talk pretty fast. Also, avoid this class if it's after lunch, because it's easy to fall asleep and get bored. Study hard for the tests, they can be a bit challenging. Overall, an okay professor."
14,5.0,2.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"He really knows what he is talking about, and is really helpful in answering questions. The class is very interesting - *IF* you're into psychology and models of cognition/memory, and he can be hilariously witty at the most random times. Tests are multiple choice/essay, and not too difficult, but you've got to go to class."
15,4.0,4.0, PSY180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,Great teacher but lectures were really boring.
16,5.0,3.0, PSYC,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,I had Prof. Mulligan for Cognative Psyc. and Human memory.  I thoroughly enjoyed both classes.  He explains the material extremely well and he is very willing to help his students.  You can tell he is interested in the material he teaches.  It is important to attend all his lectures.  I would recomend his classes to anyone interested in psychology.
17,3.0,3.0, COGPSYC,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,"Unless i just dont like the material this class was pretty dull, but he seemed nice"
18,4.0,4.0, PSYCHLAW,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,He's a nice guy but exam & paper grading is far too arbitrary. Depended exclusively on essay questions and was incredibly subjective in grading.
19,4.5,3.0, COGPSYC,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEIL,MULLIGAN,Really nice guy. Explains things thouroughly.
