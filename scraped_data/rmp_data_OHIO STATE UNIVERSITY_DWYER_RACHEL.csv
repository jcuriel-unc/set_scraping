1,4.5,2.0, SOC3463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"There's a decent amount of reading but it's not too hard.  Many classes will have a quick writing assignment (3-4 sentence reaction to a concept) that is your ""attendance"" grade.  I don't get how she's a 2.7, I showed up about 50% of the time and got a B.  Her tests are scantron and not that hard if you pay attention and read."
2,3.0,5.0, SOCI3463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,She takes random attendance - so go to every class. She talks really fast & studdars so I recommend you record her lectures. Her lectures are 90% graphs that will be translated to 50 or 100 question multiple choice. No curve and only 4 assignments (2 exams & 2 papers) for the whole semester.
3,5.0,3.0, SOC463H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"Great professor. Really loves to teach. Loved the class. Grades the papers harshly and you definitely have to study for exams because there's a lot of content. Overall though, enjoyed the class."
4,4.5,3.0, SOCH101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"She is a very enthusiastic and supportive. Lectures can get very boring very quickly, but that tends to be the nature of college classes. She does talk pretty fast, but will ask to make sure you understood the material. One midterm and final (study guides given), group project and participation. Do the work and studying and get the grade you want."
5,5.0,4.0, SOC884,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"Professor Dwyer is a thoroughly outstanding instructor who took a real interest in my success.  She strikes a careful balance between imparting information and allowing free discussion.  If I could repeat this class every quarter, I would (and I'd bet I'd learn something new every time!)  I cannot speak highly enough of the overall experience."
6,2.5,4.0, SOC101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"She is incredibly frustrating to listen to - she tends to stutter and ramble a lot. Ridiculous amount of reading assigned, and her grading is tough despite unclear expectations. Not recommended."
7,5.0,3.0, SOC101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"Honestly, I have nothing but positive things to say about this teacher.  She was very friendly and approachable.  The class was generally interesting and her expectations were clear most of the time.  She allowed me to move my final time to a more convenient time, which I greatly appreciated.  I would definitely recommend taking her course."
8,2.5,5.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,She was hard to follow...maybe needs to update her technology use in class. She doesn't like to give A's on her papers.
9,4.5,5.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"EXCELLENT PROF! She is SO smart! Talks very quickly, and is easy to zone out so bring a snack or soda to class. Go to class every day and take detailed notes (try to write everything she says) and you will do okay. Promptly responds to emails and is understanding of personal problems that conflict with class. Highly recommended(esp 4 soc majors)!"
10,4.5,4.0, SOCH463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"I took this as a GEC course and while she is helpful, responds quickly to emails, and is enthusiastic and funny, she graded hard, took bad notes on the board, and got off track and confusing sometimes during lecture. I worked really hard for a poor grade, so I'd advise taking this with another professor or a finding a different GEC."
11,3.5,4.0, SOCH463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"The discussions we had were very interesting for the most part--Dwyer takes input from a lot of people which is important. A lot of the readings are DRY, and sometimes she grades as if we were sociology majors (I don't think think one of us was). Sometimes she made the material really interesting, and sometimes I couldn't help but bring sudoku."
12,5.0,2.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,Extremely helpful and kept the class entertaining.
13,4.0,2.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"This professor was very enthusiastic, she was willing to help and very easy to talk to. She doesn't make it mandatory to come to class but if you do majority of what's on the exams is talked about. The first exam was very easy but the final was kind basically to get the slackers....."
14,4.5,3.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"I was really inspired by her! She makes things really interesting and she's really easy to talk to!  I want to look into the social stratification minor, that's how interesting she made the class!"
15,4.5,4.0, SOCH463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"This class was my favorite class ever at OSU (and I am a science major!) and she was probably the best prof I have ever had either. 2-5 pg essays,2 exams, and participation determine your grade. Fair grader...more than willing to help on essays. I didnt think tests were hard if you had good notes and of course studied! AMAZING! Take her class!"
16,5.0,3.0, SOCH101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"Wonderful lecturer, keeps things interesting and fun, and loves to have debates/conversations among the class.  She is a very fair grader, but don't expect to be able to slack off.  Just pay attention in class, read the book, and do your work, and you'll be fine.  Highly recommended."
17,5.0,2.0, 463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,Very interesting lecturer.  Kept most students interest.  Made subject matter interesting and easy to understand.  Creates her own exams so they went along with what was learned in lecture.  I had two 5 page papers to do for the class but they were nothing super difficult.
18,4.5,3.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"This was a really hard class, but she is  a fair grader and very intelligent. You can tell how passionate she is about the subject matter just by how involved she gets into her talks in class. Her lectures are really concise and, at times, even stunning. I hate sociology but I would take another class with her anyday."
19,5.0,2.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,love love love this prof.  her lectures are interesting and she knows with extreme detail what she is talking about.  she makes classes interesting by addressing relevant issues.  always willing to go out of her way to help students if they need it.  take her!  friends had her for h101 and they liked her too!
20,5.0,3.0, SOCH101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,DWYER,"She's a great teacher, and she made H101 extremely fun, interesting & relateable.  She's a bit of a tough grader, but it's nothing unreasonable.  I agree though, if you take H101, take it with her.  And make sure you speak up.  She likes people who talk a lot."
