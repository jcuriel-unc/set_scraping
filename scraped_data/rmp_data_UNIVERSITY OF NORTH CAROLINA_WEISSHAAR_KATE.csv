1,5.0,3.0, SOC124,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"Very nice, clear grading criteria, very organized, few papers, a midterm, occasional attendance check ins, group interview project. Class is half lecture half discussion/group work. Only complaint is some of the grading can we arguably a little weird, but still 10/10 recommend taking the class. "
2,5.0,3.0, SOC412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,Kate is highly educated and skilled in Sociology topics. I highly enjoyed taking Social Stratification with her. The class was highly discussion based and I enjoyed the relationships I build with peers in the class. I learned so much and really enjoyed her class.
3,5.0,2.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"She cares for students a lot. There are some essays, but she is a fair grader. Midterm is kinda challenging, and a lot of articles need to be read, but no final, and solid amount of extra credit. She is respectable and caring.  "
4,4.0,2.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"She definitely cares about student success and mental health. She was very open to suggestions, catered to student's interests, and allowed for students to be creative in their writing. The readings were sometimes long and boring, but overall fairly interesting class. "
5,5.0,3.0, SOC412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"She gives a lot of readings, but if you read them the class should be a breeze. I learned a lot this semester from her. We had 2 writing assignments, 2 quizzes, an op-ed, we had to post a reading question, and the final slot was used to present our op-ed to a small group. It is an interesting class and as long as you do what your told, you'll pass."
6,5.0,3.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"LOVED the class and Dr. Weishaar! I'd take all of her classes in a heartbeat. She's approachable, readings make sense, and class discussion is genuinely interesting + engaging. She definitely gives us everything we need to succeed. The major papers are graded pretty gently, usually by the TA."
7,4.0,2.0, SOC412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"Prof Weishaar is very knowledgeable and caring. The class and readings can get a little dry at times, but if you participate it's easier to understand the material and not get bored. This is an easy class as long as you pay attention and skim readings, no notes needed."
8,5.0,1.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,This class covered many interesting topics and Professor Weishaar made lectures enjoyable by giving students time to discuss and make comments. Workload was super light other than readings before class that were easy to skim and the final.
9,5.0,2.0, STOR412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"Professor Weisshaar is well knowledgeable in what she teaches and and follows the syllabus pretty well. There are rubrics for all assignment that is followed completely and is given prior. The textbook is free and while there are quite a few readings assigned every class, they're easy to skim. Few papers and final is a presentation on final paper."
10,5.0,2.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,Kate is an amazing professor. Very considerate. She encourages discussion and participation in class. There are quite a few readings but you can just skim them. No final exam but a final paper/presentation. Pretty easy class and an amazing professor.
11,5.0,2.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"Kate is such a sweetheart! I loved her class and it was definitely manageable. Not a lot of intensive work at all, and 3 essays including the final! Please please take a course with her if you want a relatively easy class but also want to learn a lot. Thanks Kate! :)"
12,5.0,2.0, SOCI124,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"Prof Weisshaar is so understanding of students' situations outside of class. She gives pretty interesting readings and is a good lecturer. I thought she did a good job of delivering the material respectfully and made an effort to include intersectionality and transgender stories in her material. It's also a pretty easy class, especially online."
13,5.0,3.0, SOCI124,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,Great Class. Kate is awesome! Had a few small papers and an op-ed. She is good with grading. Participation is definitely important. Quizzes on some of the readings sometime. Great class!
14,5.0,4.0, SOCI124,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"This class is very interesting, we cover many different topics and complete a few papers. The class is heavy on readings but it is manageable."
15,5.0,3.0, SOCI124,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"Professor was incredibly understanding (pandemic and personal). She cares about your mental health just as much as your work. She will check up on you if you have a missing assignment and she grades by rubric. Although I feel she could have used more intersectionality, she did use studies and we discussed race a few times. Interesting class!"
16,4.0,2.0, SOCI124,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"I took this class for a gen ed requirement and I'm really glad I did. Dr. Weisshaar is a very nice professor who goes out of her way to explain content in lectures and is always accessible outside of class. Workload is not bad at all and is mostly reading articles and posting discussion questions. Very interesting material, highly recommend!"
17,3.0,2.0, SOCI124,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"Kate is such a sweet woman and clearly cares about the material. The class is monotonous because each night you do online reading and post a discussion question then talk about it the next day in class. You write one research essay and it is graded almost point by point on an easy to follow rubric. Easy A and interesting, important information!"
18,4.0,2.0, SOCI124,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"Kate is a caring woman and tries to help you engage with the material, although the material itself is somewhat dry. The only homework is doing online readings posted and posting a discussion question. An easy A overall."
19,5.0,3.0, SOCI124,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"Kate is awesome! I have a heart condition, and no matter what, she was always willing to work with me and my illness so that I would have every opportunity to do well in her class. If you want a professor who is gonna actually care about you and the topic they teach, I would definitely recommend her."
20,5.0,2.0, SOCI124,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATE,WEISSHAAR,"Kate is literally such a sweet woman. I really enjoyed this class. She does assign a lot of reading but you don't really have to do all of them because she summarizes them in class. Nonetheless, I would recommend skimming them anyway. It's not a hard class to get an A in and I would recommend taking it."
