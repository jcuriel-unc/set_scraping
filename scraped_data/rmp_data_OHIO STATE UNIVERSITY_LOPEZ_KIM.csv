1,5.0,4.0, SOC3630,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,Loved this class and Kim presented the material really well. You have to work for it though as the exams can be tough and the course paper requires a significant investment in time to get a good grade. Great instructor overall and invites lots of guest speakers which adds to the application of the course material to real life.
2,5.0,2.0, SOC2290,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"Kim is literally amazing! She is such a sweetheart and taught a difficult class with grace, kindness, and openness. She does everything in her power to make the class stimulating, but it is on the lecture heavy side. I can't wait to take another class with her! "
3,5.0,2.0, SOC2290,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"Although this was a very emotional tolling class, Kim made sure that everybody in the class was mentally okay with what we were learning. She gives out a study sheet before the tests and the tests are easy if you study and know the material. If you show up to class, you are more than likely to get an A. "
4,5.0,2.0, SOC2290,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,Amazing instructor!
5,5.0,3.0, SOCI2370,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"My familiarity with the content of this course made it easy in a sense but the format of this professors course was kinda wacky. There are two books used and one of them is an interesting/odd book about hookup culture in college, the other is a more traditional textbook. I comfortably got an A, but it did take completing some involved assignments."
6,5.0,3.0, SOC2290,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"I've taken 3 classes with Kim and I loved all of them. Her lectures are really engaging, and it is clear that she cares about her students. The classes aren't super easy, but the expectations are clear and there are chances for bonus points. She is really caring and very passionate about the subjects she teaches. Best professor I've had at OSU"
7,2.0,4.0, SOC3630,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"Won't get an A+ unless your assignments exactly appease her rubric to her comprehension, unfair grading. However, passionate about her field and very educated. She will discuss with you if you have concerns. She does not care very much about personal circumstances. Tough class. Heavy material. Little compassion. "
8,1.0,3.0, SOC2290,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"I honestly have no clue how Kim Lopez has a 4.9 / 5 on here. She lacks any sort of accountability and she is not flexible AT ALL. She also pressured a student into sharing something they were obviously not comfortable with sharing, which shows a complete lack of care for that student's feelings. The worst professor I've ever had by far."
9,5.0,3.0, SOC2290,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"Kim Lopez is passionate in the subject matter and inspirational as a professor. Easy classes, study hard for exams and read the materials. "
10,5.0,3.0, SOC2370,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"I really enjoyed Kims lectures, they were always very engaging and she explained the concepts very well. She was also very flexible and understanding with students situations and had very sensible late work policy. In my class we were allowed to drop 3 assignments (except really big ones) no questions asked. Any class with her is one worth taking"
11,5.0,2.0, SOC3434,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,Be professor Ive ever had. Shes very passionate about what she does and it shows in the class. She wanted to help me outside of the class and that was amazing. I recommend her to every friend!! I would definitely join her class again!
12,3.0,3.0, SOC2290,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,She is an amazing lecturer and you can tell she is passionate about the subject matter. This is one of my favorite classes but I would warn anyone who is SLDS or has a bad laptop. She is not flexible and a really harsh grader. My grade dropped a whole letter grade halfway through the semester because she refused to work wth me on a testing mishap.
13,5.0,2.0, SOC2370,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"Kim is a great professor. She is very clear on what she expects for assignments. Class is lecture-heavy so sometimes it gets boring. Tests are all open note and mostly based on the study guide. She is very easy to contact and sometimes puts out little messages regarding mental health, which are very appreciated. Overall, very manageable course."
14,5.0,3.0, SOC3630,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"Kim is one of the best professors I have had at Ohio State. She cares about her students so much and is very understanding. Although this class does require effort, the material and books we went over were very interesting and very important no matter your major. Kim is a great lecturer, and caring individual! I highly recommend this class."
15,5.0,3.0, SOC2290,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"Kim was the best professor I have ever had! I am finishing up her course right now on Death and Dying and plan on taking her course on Medical Soc, Fall '21. She is incredibly nice and is willing to work with you if needed. Her tests could be challenging but if you study you will be fine. She is a genuine person and truly cares about your success."
16,5.0,2.0, PSY2340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"One of the best professors I had at CSCC. Dr. Lopez is caring, understanding and most importantly I like the way she teaches. If you do your work you will get an easy A class."
17,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL3434,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"Kim is my favorite professor that I have ever had. She is flexible, communicates content clearly, and is always available for questions. Lectures are mandatory, but she makes lecture so interesting that I never wanted to skip. Her courses are reading-heavy, but it pays off to read them. I would recommend her for any class at the University."
18,5.0,3.0, SOC2370,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"She is clearly passionate about the subject and knows what she's talking about. The class material was very interesting. The tests were difficult but not impossible, and I always ended up doing better than I expected. The book for the class is interesting but I skimmed it, and I didn't use the textbook except for the final paper."
19,5.0,3.0, SOC3630,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"Kim is a great teacher that cares a lot about her students. She expects a lot out you, but it never seemed like an unreasonable amount of work. It may seem like there are a lot of assignments at first, but they are all pretty easy if you give yourself time and don't wait until the last minute to start. Tests aren't a cakewalk, but not too hard."
20,5.0,3.0, SOC2370,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KIM,LOPEZ,"Kim was a great professor! I felt that she genuinely had a passion for her subject. She doesn't round up/give extra credit, which isn't an issue for many but for some it could be. Her exams were tough, but not ""trick questions"" if that makes sense. You'll have to study before the exams, but you won't be shocked by questions if you've read materials"
