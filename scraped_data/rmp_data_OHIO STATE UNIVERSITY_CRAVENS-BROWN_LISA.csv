1,5.0,1.0, ARTSSCI113713,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,Dr. Cravens-Brown was awesome. This class was about psychology podcasts and was mainly a discussion-based class. She was very interesting and intelligent and it was a very engaging class that felt like a community. It's very easy to get an A as long as you show up every day and do the discussion posts.
2,4.0,3.0, PSYCH5681,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"She's friendly and approachable, and I enjoyed taking her class. No textbook, but a lot of reading in her class, mainly research articles for group projects. Be prepared to communicate/work with many different people in the class; almost every day is a group project with a randomly-assigned group. Graded on completion of assignments and attendance."
3,3.0,4.0, 4532PSYC,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"Conflicted about her - very good, high quality prof who's passionate about clinical psych. but her teaching style is unorthodox - no lectures which means no notes/slides. Class title is deceptive - not actually about clinical psych. Exams are essay for better/worse but lots of extra credit opps. grading is strict. nothing is hard but unfamilar."
4,5.0,4.0, PSYCH33302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,She made class fun and interesting.
5,5.0,4.0, PSYCH2333,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"She made class funny and interesting. I never skipped this class. There aren't any major surprises on her tests, just study the material and you'll do well."
6,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2333,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"You need the book for the online exams. I can't imagine trying to do those without it. Participation matters a lot, it's like 30% of your grade, but she's hilarious so it was rare that I didn't want to go to class."
7,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2333,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"Definitely the best professor I've had at OSU! Couldn't bring myself to skip her class because it was so fun. Exams are all online, and a decent amount of your grade comes from attendance/participation. She makes topics that are sometimes seen as taboo really easy to discuss. Show up and make sure you get the textbook and you'll pass."
8,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2333,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"Dr. CB is awesome! Super engaged in lectures and gives really relatable/funny personal stories. Makes the topic of sex very comfortable and fun. Uses random tophat questions for participation points. Exams are all online and decently easy. Buy/rent the book. Definitely recommend taking her and this class, you won't regret it!"
9,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2333,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"She is just wonderful. So engaged in class with interesting material to lecture on. She doesn't lecture on what is on the textbook so that part is up to you, but the textbook is an easy read."
10,4.0,2.0, PSYCH4543,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"Lisa was a professor that cared A LOT about what she taught, as well as having a good relationship with her students. This class style is different than others in the way that there were no exams, almost all of the points came from in-class participation and assignments. Its a good filler class, but there is work during class unlike others."
11,5.0,1.0, PSYCH4543,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"I learned so much from Lisa in my gender class. For one, she didn't teach a regular lecture(slide)class. The students were communicating with each other, and the conversations had a lasting impression on me. I find myself talking about the content of the course to everyone I encounter now. Thank you for this delightful experience, Lisa."
12,5.0,1.0, PSYCH4543,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"I thought I didn't like her for like a good month or 2, but turns out she is really cool. I just didn't  how it sounded as if she was getting smart with me when I spoke to her."
13,3.5,2.0, PSYCH2333,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,I loved this class. The professor is super hilarious and makes the class engaging. Easy A if you take notes.
14,4.0,3.0, PSYCH2333,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"I love Lisa!! I've taken two of her classes and she's been great for both of them. The tests can be a little tricky, especially for this class. (But I also didn't read as much as I should've.) Her lectures are fun and interesting, and she's very approachable and loves to help you out if you go to office hours."
15,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2333,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"Dr. CB is my favorite teacher I have ever had. The subject material is my academic focus, so I'm biased in saying that it is super interesting, but I think most people agree, it rocks. The tests are entirely based off of in-class lectures, so you have to show up, but you'll want to come anyways because the class rocks. "
16,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"She is one of my favorite teachers, you can tell she loves what she does.   She also does a great job at making lectures interesting.  But make sure you attend class, she does a lot of participation points"
17,4.5,1.0, 4543,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,Professor Cravens-Brown was amazing!! A lot of particpation so attendance is a must!! But you'll find yourself wanting to go to learn about the day's discussion and subject! She was always bright and cheery and really made the class quite delightful!
18,3.5,4.0, 2200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"SO many in class assignments, hard tests, but she was a good teacher and stats was required for a psych degree so if you have to take this class then I would take it with her because I was actually able to understand the content "
19,3.0,2.0, 4555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"Lisa C-B is one of the most unaccommodating professor at Ohio State.  Attendance is required because she does random in class assignments worth way too many points. One time I had to leave class FIVE minutes early to get to another midterm and she wouldnt let me make up the points. Told me ""a kids dad died and she wouldnt let her make it up either"""
20,4.5,3.0, 2333,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,CRAVENS-BROWN,"Dr. Cravens-Brown is an extremely intellectual woman, and I recommend taking her Human Sexuality class to anyone who may be interested. She's very clear about grades from the get-go and attending class is paramount since almost all of the exam questions are based on lectures (maybe 15% come from the book, so you need to have it as well)."
