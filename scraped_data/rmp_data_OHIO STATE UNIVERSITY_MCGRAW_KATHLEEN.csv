1,4.0,4.0, PS4137,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,"I did not think I would like her or the class but I was wrong! Great class if you're interested in law or CJS. Straight forward lectures; clean, to the point slides and class almost always ends 15 min early. It takes work to get an A but its nothing unmanagable. Study guides cover everything on the exams! Exams: MC + ID terms and short answers."
2,2.0,4.0, PS3170,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,"Course seemed basic enough at first, but I quickly realized how dry Prof. McGraw's was. The subject matter is fairly interesting, but lectures are stuffed and very boring. Exams are ridiculous, mostly multiple choice but they test the most insignificant details. And if you mess up, they're worth 35%, so good luck. First W, I say avoid at all costs."
3,4.0,3.0, 4137POLISCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,"Midterm (35%), final (35%) (noncumulative) and paper (30%). Gives out very detailed study guides for the exams which have around 40 MC questions and 10-15 short answer. Paper is over a famous court trial in the 20th century. Material covered in class is very interesting. Focused on the criminal justice system. Put in the time in and get the grade. "
4,1.0,5.0, 3170,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,"I usually do not post any type of review or rating for professors. I, however, believed this to be an instance where such was imperative. In my correspondence with Prof. McGraw, she was rude, condescending, and unnecessarily degrading. He behavior was inexcusable and completely unprofessional, and therefore I do not recommend any of her courses."
5,4.0,3.0, PS515,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,Professor McGraw is a great lecturer. Her notes a clear and she tells you exactly what she is looking for. Plus class was usually only an hour long! She provides an overly detailed study guide.
6,4.5,4.0, POLSC515,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,"I really can't say enough about this professor. I found her to be very intelligent and engaging, and I found the course material to be relevant and applicable as a great intro to law. The reading is the lecture, and the lecture is very well structured. Attend the class. If you do the work in this class, you get the grade."
7,3.5,4.0, PS515,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,"Prof is very liberal and not afraid to tell you that. However she is a pretty good instructor, but her exams are kinda tough. She provides a study guide, but it is in about size 8 font, with 2 columns on each side of the page and packed full of EVERYTHING that was covered the whole time, so it really doesn't help you focus your studying much."
8,5.0,3.0, POLS503,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,great professor got promoted to chair so wont be teaching for a while
9,5.0,2.0, PS515,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,I find it hard to believe that she didn't learn students names in the aformentioned class...because in my class of 60+ she knows a good deal of names (maybe you just have to participate.) Great prof...515 is a very interesting class.
10,5.0,3.0, SEVERAL,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,"Assigns a lot of work, but exams and grading are very reasonable.  If you get to know her, you'll think she's fabulous."
11,2.0,1.0, PS514,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,"She makes no attempt to learn students' names or get to know them.  Her tests are extremely easy, but there's a long paper at the end (but she grades that easily, too.) She seemed to not enjoy teaching."
12,2.5,4.0, POLSCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,not very nice at all (i'm not bitter -- got a good grade but still).
13,5.0,3.0, POLSCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHLEEN,MCGRAW,Wonderful prof. One of the best at Ohio State!
