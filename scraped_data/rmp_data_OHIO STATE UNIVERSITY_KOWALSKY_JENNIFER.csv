1,2.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,KOWALSKY,"Professor Kowalsky was very friendly and knowledgeable. However, lectures consist of mass amounts of notes, and study guides are so general it is impossible to know what concepts to focus on. I wish the information was paired down or more concise on the powerpoints. Be prepared to write and watch videos outside of class that will breakdown material"
2,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,KOWALSKY,She's assigning bonus points to students who give her good ratings on here to offset the bad ratings. Very poor grader and does not give feedback. Probably the weakest professor in the entire department. Avoid her classes like the plague.
3,4.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,KOWALSKY,I really enjoyed Dr. Ks class. Its a tough class in general but I really liked her approach. Shes a heavy lecturer because theres a lot of material but shes always happy to take small detours to discuss our thoughts on the subjects were going over. Shes very cheerful and tries to make it clear what will be on exams. Be prepared to take notes
4,4.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,KOWALSKY,"Quizzes and exams are gonna be okay if you read the textbook/PowerPoints and review notes. Memorizing is a skill thats gonna be needed. Make sure you make a friend in class you can refer to in case you miss something, cause lectures are kinda fast. Semester was suddenly switched to online, but she made it really easy for us which I appreciated."
5,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,KOWALSKY,Unlike Dr. Kowalsky's other reviews I think her class was pretty straightforward. I would say that this course by its very nature is content dense but I think she does what she can. Her lectures are very dense but as long as you take good notes and memorize 90-95% of her lectures you'll get an A. She drops the lowest exam including the final.
6,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,KOWALSKY,"Do not take! She gives zero direction for exams- no study guide and her notes are small novels for each chapter. Be prepared to write entire paragraphs that she recites from memory multiple times for you to copy. Extremely tough grader and gives no direction. Doesn't give exams back, wont go over them. By far the worst prof I have had."
7,1.0,5.0, PSYCH4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,KOWALSKY,"This professors hiring seams a bit premature . This is her first semester teaching and I think Dr. Kowalsky gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ""You can be intelligent, but be a poor teacher"". Her lecture notes run to 20+ page per exam making it impossible for repeated repetition to study for, & exams don't reflect the entirety of the lectures."
8,1.0,4.0, PSY4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,KOWALSKY,"Sadly, this professor was the worst I have had in my 4 years in college. Her lectures are boring, vaugue and she moves painfully slow. She gives no study guides, no review sessions, and no advice on what to focus on for her VERY hard exams that cover information she never even talks about in class. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROFESSOR!"
9,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,KOWALSKY,"hardest class I have ever taken in my 3 years so far. Not only is her class super heavy in terms of content, but there is no guidance whatsoever. She does not give out study guides to help narrow down on topics, and her exams are ridiculous. The exams ask very specific detailed questions over content hardly even mentioned in class. Do NOT take her."
10,1.0,3.0, PSYCH4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,KOWALSKY,"This has been the most boring and unbearable class ive taken in my college career. Every class is lecture only. She talks incredibly. She does not allow review for exams, instead at the beginning of each class she just asks what we learned in the last class. Also does not let you look at your exam after its graded."
