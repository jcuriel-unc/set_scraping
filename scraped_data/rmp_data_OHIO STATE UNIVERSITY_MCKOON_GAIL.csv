1,1.0,3.0, PSYCH4510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,MCKOON,"No rubrics are given for papers or assignments and lectures are very unclear. Do not expect any clarity or meaningful communication, you are on your own. She offers a good amount of extra credit, so pulling an A isn't too hard."
2,2.0,1.0, PSYCH4510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,MCKOON,"I'm baffled by other reviews.  This class is one of the easiest A's I've ever had.  Exams are super straightforward and you only have to write a few short papers.  Sure the lecture notes are incomprehensible on their own but Dr. McKoon is plenty clear during class.  Paper grading is also a little arbitrary, but bonus assignment makes up for this."
3,1.0,5.0, PSYCH510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,MCKOON,"Majority of the final was related to memory/priming etc., rather than what we were supposed to learn; research methods! As a senior psych student, this is one of the worst classes I've attended in my academic career. Away like the plague as they say."
4,1.0,5.0, PSY510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,MCKOON,Worst class/professor i have ever had in my college career. Grading scale is out of no where. Little to know feed back to even know why you are being deducted points. Late assignment returns which leads to repeaqted mistakes. Generaly she seems as though she doesnt care at all. Aviod this professor if possible.
5,1.0,5.0, PSYCH510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,MCKOON,Unclear directions and whimsical grading system. Assignment instructions do not match how they are graded.
6,1.5,4.0, PSY510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,MCKOON,This class is by far one of the worst classes I have ever taken!!! Like the comment below she will make you turn in assignments before getting the prior assignment back so you are unable to change the mistakes for the next assignment. Her tests include information that is clearly irrelevant to the material!!!!
7,1.0,4.0, PSYCH510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,MCKOON,"Lectures were incomprehensible, but you better take notes to do well on the exam. She waits until you have done your second paper before handing back the first, so the same mistakes are made. She turned what should have been an easy A into a class you have to struggle in. Eventually she decided to give extra extra credit, which may redeem my grade."
8,1.0,4.0, PSYCH510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,MCKOON,"Avoid this class at all costs. It is the most boring and useless class I have ever taken. While the class isnt super hard, she jumps around the entire lecture and hands out notes that mean nothing making class basically mandatory. Lab isnt bad though, always get out in like an hour. Avoid taking if not required, not interesting at all."
9,1.5,5.0, PSYCH510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,MCKOON,The exams are very difficult to study for. In lecture she skips around so much it is hard to stay awake and follow what she is saying. The TA would tell us things opposite to what Dr. McKoon said. Neither were that helpful. I would stay away from this class unless you enjoy being stressed and have to. I still received an A after a huge huge curve.
10,2.5,3.0, PSYCH510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,MCKOON,Going to class is crucial other other wise the notes she gives mean nothing. She likes for people to do well so she alters the grading scale. For lab we never spent the whole time only an hr at the most.
