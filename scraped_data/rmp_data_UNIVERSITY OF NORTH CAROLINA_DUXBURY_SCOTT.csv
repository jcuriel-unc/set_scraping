1,5.0,1.0, SOCI318,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,Dr. Duxbury was amazing. This class was super interesting and very manageable. He was very accommodating to those of us without any coding experience. He gave really good feedback and was available outside of class to get help. Can definitely get an A if you show up and do all the work. Highly recommend!
2,5.0,3.0, SOCI123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"Scott is one of the best professors I've had at unc! He is so kind and is always available to answer your questions outside of class. Class went by so fast because the discussions were always really interesting and inspirational. He is such a smart and funny professor. Take this class if you can, you wont regret it! "
3,5.0,2.0, SOC123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"I loved this class so much! It was super interesting and not too hard. We had weekly quizzes and biweekly writing assignments, but most of the grade was the midterm and final, which were both open note. I would definitely recommend this class!"
4,5.0,2.0, SOCI123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"I took SOCI 318 (not 123) with Professor Duxbury and it was my favorite class I have taken at UNC so far. Professor Duxbury is very understanding and makes content extremely interesting, 10/10 would recommend this class and Professor Duxbury for students within every major!"
5,5.0,1.0, SOCI123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"I had Scott in Fall 2021, and he's an excellent professor. He's a criminologist so he really knows the subject matter. He's always approachable and very flexible. It would be pretty difficult to get less than an A in his class; just pay attention, do the short assigned writing, and follow the study guide for the midterm/final. Great teacher!"
6,5.0,1.0, SOC123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,Scott was the greatest Prof I had last semester. He really cared about his students and has a super simple grading scheme. If you show up to class and take the quizzes + exams which are open note then youll be fine. He assigns reading but you can get by without doing them. Definitely a GPA boosting class
7,5.0,2.0, SOCI290,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"Probably the best professor I've had at UNC. The class covers some difficult material, but Scott is great at making it easy to understand. As long as you show up and do your best, you'll get an A."
8,5.0,2.0, SOCI123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,Scott made lectures interesting and always stopped to answer questions and have spontaneous class discussions. All assignments or quizzes/tests were simple and open-note. Class flew by.
9,5.0,2.0, SOCI123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"Very clear expectations, good amount of graded items, no one type of assignment (quizzes, papers, participation, exams) was weighted too heavily. He's always willing to explain and discuss topics. Readings only mattered for the weekly quizzes, not exams. Midterm and finals were direct from study guide."
10,5.0,2.0, SOCI123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,Professor Duxbury is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is so intelligent and explains concepts clearly. I've learned so much in his class. He is also caring and will work with you if things come up. He is clearly more interested that we learn in his class rather than being a tough grader. Highly recommend taking his classes!
11,5.0,2.0, SOCI290,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"Duxbury made this class very enjoyable. He is very transparent about caring for his students and wanting them to learn and does not intend to overload them with homework or give bad grades. The content covered in the course is interesting, and Duxbury does a good job of teaching some difficult machine learning processes. Highly recommend!"
12,5.0,2.0, SOCI290,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"This man has my favorite type of teaching style -- informative but not bulky presentation slides, clear and concise when explaining the material, and encourages engagement from the class. Not to mention he's a very understanding professor. SOCI290 is not hard if you've done stats/R classes, the reading is cool and the HW/quiz aren't hard."
13,5.0,2.0, SOCI123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"Loved this class! Super easy A--short & easy weekly quizzes, 1-page reflections every other week, an easy midterm & final. Classes were interesting, would definitely recommend."
14,5.0,3.0, SOCI290,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"Computational Sociology is a really interesting class. Although a very complex topic, Scott makes it seem clear through his lectures. The work is hard, but he walks you through the R and is very helpful if you need it. Definitely recommend!"
15,5.0,2.0, SOCI123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"Professor Duxbury gives great lectures that are easy to follow. His tests are very similar to his lectures and are very straightforward and simple. Duxbury is very understanding about late work and the workload is not too heavy. The main grades are from discussion posts, weekly quizzes, and small writing assignments."
16,5.0,2.0, SOCI123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"Best professor I've had in the 4 years I've been at UNC! He provides the reading material, exams & quizzes were super reasonable, lecture slides are available on Sakai, he explains topics well, has optional zoom meetings during class time, and is super helpful! He's very accommodating to students' needs and is super chill/friendly!"
17,5.0,2.0, SOCI123,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SCOTT,DUXBURY,"Probably my favorite professor I've ever had at UNC. The class was a super easy A as well, definitely recommend!"
