1,2.5,4.0, PSYCH5613H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,Bruno is a smart guy but he's kinda losing it at times. He can become hard to follow as he drifts off topic.  He usually catches himself.  He shakes a lot and is clearly trying hard to compensate.  
2,4.5,4.0, PSYCH5613H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"Is very clear in his lectures.  Does not provide ""notes"", so must attend class if you want to do well.  Very passionate about the subject and wants his students to be.  Usually willing to offer help or re-explain something, unless your question is too dumb.  Tests are difficult, but if you attend class there are no surprises.  "
3,3.5,4.0, PSYCH4501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,Dr. Bruno is a great lecturer. His exams can be tough but you at least feel like you are learning something in that class instead of just regurgitating information like you have to do for most classes. If you actually want to learn neuroscience then take this class.
4,5.0,5.0, PSYCH501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,best lecturer I've ever had.
5,4.0,4.0, PSYCH501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"He's one of the best teachers for neuroscience. He's a great lecturer. One bad thing about the class is that there is not enough points in the class. If you don't attend lecture, you'll probably fair. Be warned, his exam questions can be convoluted."
6,2.0,3.0, PSYCH501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"This guy is in need of an honest review. No doubt, he is a great lecturer but he is never available. I'm pretty sure his office hours don't meet the university's minimum requirements. The class structure is inherently flawed as it is only out of 80 points. His mult. choice questions aren't hard, they're merely convoluted. Most over rated professor."
7,4.5,5.0, PSYCH501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"Best professor I've had at OSU, very helpful and approachable and great sense of humor. Tests are near impossible, he expects you to think on the level of grad students, which is not unreasonable for a high level course, but still takes you off guard."
8,4.5,4.0, PSYCHH613,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"I had Professor Bruno for Psych 501 and H613.  He is a phenomenal professor and his lectures are awesome (I hated missing his class).  His courses are definitely no cake walk, but you can really learn a lot from him.  He is also very fair with grades and will say that he prefers to reward people for taking hard classes (like his)."
9,4.5,4.0, PSYCH501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"He doesn't take attendance, but it is impossible to do well without attending lecture. If you attend lecture, pay attention, take good notes, and study hard you can do well.  This isn't an easy class and not really psychology. It's studying the advanced physiology and neuroscience of the human brain and neurological disorders. Loved it and the prof"
10,4.0,5.0, PSYCH501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"He is a great teacher and you will learn a lot.  However, it is an EXTREMELY difficult class.  I took it while taking 24 credit hours and I simply didn't have the time to do well in the course.  Only take it if you have LOTS of time to dedicate to the class.  Also, he doesn't require attendance, but you have to go to pass."
11,5.0,5.0, PSYCHH613,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"Had him for 501 and H613. Very hard courses, but if you are good at integrating information, getting the ""big picture"" and knowing the details he emphasizes, you can pull off an A. It takes a lot of effort though. TONS of reading for 613. I recommend him, even if it slashes your GPA!"
12,5.0,4.0, PSYCH501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"His class is pretty hard, especially if you are a psychology major. It is not as difficult if you have a biology background, but still watch out for his multiple choice questions! But he is an extremely engaging teaching and loves what he is talking about. I would highly recommend his course. He is very approachable and pretty cool dude."
13,2.5,5.0, PSYCH597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,This class was too difficult; I am not sure that he realized it was a GEC and not an upper lever Neuro-biology class!  Class seemed interesting but for the same amount of work I put in to getting As in other classes I was getting a D in this one.
14,5.0,5.0, PSYCH501H613,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"Fabulous teacher.  SO difficult, but made my whole experience at OSU worth it.  He will challenge you to your limits.  He seems curt sometimes, but he is really nice, just not the best at expressing it.  Be prepared to be called on in class to answer impossible questions. Don't take his classes if you aren't willing to work your butt off for an A!"
15,4.0,4.0, PSYCH501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"Multiple choice exams VERY difficult. An awesome class none the less. I learned a lot. He once said that even if you get a C in his class you will know more than the average layman about PD and AD, and he's right."
16,5.0,3.0, PSYCHBIO,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"Wonderful professor.  Very informative.  His multiple choice tests are extremely hard, but you learn so much."
17,4.5,4.0, 501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"Dr. Bruno is very tough, no doubt about that.  But, you can learn A LOT from him.  His multiple choice exams are infamous for their difficulty, but if you go to his office hours, he'll point you in the right direction."
18,5.0,4.0, PSY501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"Not only a passionate and challenging teacher, but an awesome person too.  Helpful in and out of the classroom."
19,5.0,4.0, PSYCH501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"Excellent teacher, brilliant person. he expects a lot but he is very helpful to anyone who really wants to learn"
20,5.0,4.0, PSYCH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,BRUNO,"he expects a lot out of you, but in a good way"
