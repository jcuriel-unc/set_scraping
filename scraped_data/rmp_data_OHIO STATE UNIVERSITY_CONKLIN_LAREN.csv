1,3.5,4.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAREN,CONKLIN,"she's a very boring lecturer, so i found it hard to pay attention..but she offers a TON of extra credit which helped me pass the class."
2,5.0,1.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAREN,CONKLIN,She's fun and quirky. Typical quirky nerd girl. She's relatively well versed on the subject and is very willing to help. Hardly EVER opened the book. I'll prolly lightly use it for finals.
3,5.0,1.0, PSYCH331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAREN,CONKLIN,"Didn't do well in the last 2 exams but still got an A.. due to the awesome extra credit. She might not have tons of jokes to entertain you, but if you really listen, the class is actually interesting. she is very nice and helpful too. the exam are not super easy, but read the slides, you will be fine."
4,2.5,1.0, PSYCH331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAREN,CONKLIN,"Even though the class was super easy, especially with all the extra credit, I hated every single minute of it.  She's a boring lecturer and goes on and on about the easiest and most self explanatory concepts."
5,2.0,5.0, PSYCH331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAREN,CONKLIN,If you are not a psychology major there is NO point in taking this class. The tests are HARD and badly worded. I'm dissapointed on how little I learned from this class.
6,5.0,2.0, PSYCH331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAREN,CONKLIN,"3 tests, 5 pop quizzes (1 dropped), so many extra credit opportunities. never read the book and i still got a B+. everything is off her slides. shes really nice and fair. loved her class."
7,4.5,2.0, PSYCH331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAREN,CONKLIN,"I relied solely on the lectures and pulled an A-. She just got her master's, but she is a really good teacher. Very hot too!"
8,5.0,3.0, PSYCH309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAREN,CONKLIN,"She was extremely friendly, interested in the material, knowledgeable and was always willing to help her students. I had her in abnormal psych and I hope to have Laren for another psych course!"
