1,5.0,3.0, EASTCNTEUROPE,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Dr. Vachudova is the best professor/teacher I have ever been taught by.  She always engages and prepares for class in an expert-like fashion. It is clear she knows what she is doing. Especially having to deal with students who never want to do the work, anything would be too hard for those looking for an easy A. 100% would recommend! "
2,3.0,3.0, POLI438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"She is kind, a little disoriented, but wants to be there for her students. Has a lot of office hours and wants you to come. Very few grades so you have no idea where you stand until like the last week of class. Takes forever to get grades back as well. She did grade pretty leniently though. Lots and lots of reading for homework, so be prepared."
3,5.0,3.0, POLI438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"MAV is one of my favorite professors I've had - so funny, caring and kind! Her lectures are straight-forward, engaging and always include current events which keep the class up to date. 1 big research paper, 2 midterms, final exam and participation make up the grade. Not too hard to get an A, but you need to definitely put in effort!"
4,5.0,3.0, POLI438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Professor Vachudova is the best prof. I've had at UNC - coming from a Senior. She cares greatly about the subject matter, her students, and her students' success in and out of the classroom. She gives engaging lectures (participation in them a must for this course) and is easily available outside of lecture to talk about class or even just life."
5,5.0,2.0, POLI438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Dr. Vachudova is a wonderful person and a great professor. She gives great feedback on assignments and is understanding about any outside circumstances. While lectures can sometimes be unclear, she provides good study guides and interesting, open-ended questions on tests. I would 100% take a class with Dr. Vachudova again."
6,5.0,2.0, POLI438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,Dr. Vachudova is an amazing person and is super accessible outside class. She has a lot of knowledge but is willing to indulge student curiosities and questions in class. She genuinely cares about her students and their learning. I would 100% take a class with her again!
7,5.0,3.0, POLI438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Pre Waring: Grading is slow, but the class is great. I loved her lectures, Prof V is super knowledgeable on the topic. Lecture slides are detailed but attendance is mandatory. Grading is specific and takes awhile but gives great feedback. If you do the readings, and go to office our for paper help you will be fine! Overall learned a lot"
8,1.0,3.0, POLI438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Dr. Vachudova is a very nice lady and is lenient with deadlines. If you're looking to actually learn about Europe, take a different class. The way she taught this class did not make any sense and I don't think she really cared much about it either. She never provides feedback on assignments even though the requirements were always confusing."
9,5.0,4.0, POLI438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Prof. Vachudova is the best. She truly cares about her students and will easily work with you if you ask. Reading/workload is what you'd expect from a 400-level class, but she makes it not a drag. She is clearly an expert on East/Central Europe -- definitely take her if you have any interest in the region."
10,5.0,2.0, POLI438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Prof. Vachduova was a great professor who's super passionate and knowledgeable about the material she teaches. Super interesting books/readings combined with easy-to-follow lectures made for a very easy class experience, even when we transitioned to online learning. Plus, she's super kind and helped make the class as easy as possible."
11,5.0,2.0, POLI438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Vachudova is a great teacher. Super funny, super chill, and loves to tell stories. Pretty easy grader, and loves to give advice. 10/10 teacher!"
12,5.0,3.0, POLI438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"AWESOME. Love Professor Vachudova. She is one of the most, if not the most qualified professors I have, and am sure will ever have at UNC. She is witty, kind, and an expert on all things East and Central Europe. Would recommend to anyone!"
13,2.5,2.0, POLI236,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Super nice lady, but she is so disorganized and unclear. There are pop quizzes on the most random things, she gives HUGE amounts of reading plus emails you tons of additional articles, and the tests are unclear. I got a C- on the midterm but still managed to get a B+ in the class, so can't complain. TA's do most of the grading"
14,4.5,3.0, POLI236,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Really interesting class material, however I hate the grading percentages. Two exams, a few pop quizzes, and recitation participation. The exams and quizzes are either based on random things she finds important or from ridiculously long readings assigned every week. The TA's do all the work in this class but Milada is a good lecturer."
15,3.0,2.0, POLI431,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"She typically misses several days of class due to research abroad but due to her lack of attendance, she grades pretty easy-- she'll even tell you so."
16,5.0,3.0, EASTEURO,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Excellent Professor; she makes the subject so interesting and fun! She also has great stories to tell of her childhood in the former Yugoslavia.  Very approachable as well and fair on her exams.  I was not surprised by any of the content.  Overall, one of the best political science professors I had at UNC."
17,2.0,2.0, POLI236,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"What a worthless class.  It's pure history rather than politics.  Vachudova is a nice woman, but she teaches in generalizations and stereotypes, lecture is pointless, and the TAs do all the work in recitation.  Exams are vague and don't test knowledge, rather your understanding of what she wants you to say.  This course is a complete waste of time."
18,4.0,3.0, POLI236,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"never had poli sci before this class. it wasn't bad considering i'm not the best at politics/history. she's generally late. very helpful if you go see her. i was confused until the exam (which is all short answer) but she gives you credit for putting something down as long as it isn't stupid. try to keep up w/ readings, go to class!"
19,5.0,3.0, POLI57121,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,Wonderful teacher.  Very knowledgeable about the subject matter.  Makes things interesting.
20,5.0,3.0, EASTCNTEUROPE,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MILADA,VACHUDOVA,"Great teacher, entertaining and personable with great stories.  I learned alot too!"
