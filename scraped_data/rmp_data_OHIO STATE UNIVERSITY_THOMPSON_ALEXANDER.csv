1,2.0,3.0, POLISCI4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Even though the class isn't assignment-heavy, the tests are pretty brutal. The exams are taken online. I wish we had more time to get them done. This isn't an easy A, btw. If you're looking for that, don't take the class. "
2,4.0,3.0, POLITSC4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Great guy, very knowledgeable & approachable. Lectures r interesting. Provides lecture outlines, but exams will be hard if u don't go to class & take notes. Grade is determined by 3 exams & 1 paper. Paper is easy. Content on exams is easy, MC and ID terms/SA, but very time constrained. Do the readings bc u need to cite them on the exam. Fair class"
3,5.0,2.0, 4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,Dr.Thompson is humble instructor and an approachable instructor. He explains everything clearly and makes class entertaining. He is happy to answer questions and give clear feedback. 
4,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Professor Thompson knows a lot about what he teaches and is genuinely interested in it, which makes him an excellent teacher. Talk with him when you get the chance, he's friendly and can be very helpful. Show up and take good notes on the slides and you'll do fine."
5,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Dr. Thompson was an excellent instructor. The material was interesting, and he let us apply it to real life. The work was reasonable but make sure that you do well on his midterm and final exams as there are not too many grades in the course. The professor is also very friendly and approachable, so don't be scared to contact or visit him during off"
6,4.0,3.0, POLITSC4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"3 exams and a paper, each worth 25%. You have to know your stuff for the exams because he only gives you 50min for 30 multiple choice and 2 short answer questions . You can tell he really enjoys teaching. This makes his lectures entertaining. However, he was prone to getting off topic by answering questions. Lastly, the readings were long and dull."
7,5.0,2.0, POLITSC4335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"I recommend this teacher for everyone to take. He is very nice and is easy to talk to. However, you're not graded on too many things so you have to do well on the exams, but overall not that hard of a class to pass and get a good grade in."
8,5.0,2.0, POLISCI4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,Professor Thompson was great this semester. His lectures are PowerPoint led and he explains the main points in the lecture. Study powerpoints for tests and youll pass easily.. attendance isnt mandatory but he does discuss some things on test in class
9,5.0,2.0, POLISCI4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Super funny and knowledgable guy. Took him for UN Systems 4331 and Environmental Politics 4335 and they were both very informative. I didn't always read the textbook, but he does have some of that material built into his exams. Helpful powerpoints though, so if you study those you'll do fine. You have to attend to understand them though!"
10,3.0,3.0, POLISCI4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Three exams and a paper. No final, and the exams aren't cumulative. Also if you do well on half the exams and the paper, he will probably curve your grade. Mine was curved from a B+ to an A-. Also offers extra credit on your final grade."
11,5.0,2.0, PS4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Prof. Thompson is great, funny & approacable. There are 3 noncumulative exams and a paper. Exams are MC & then 3 ID terms you write about in detail. Readings show up on the exam but you only need to know the main arguments made in each! DO take if you have an IR focus. Only wish there were study guides for the exams. Other than that I learned alot!"
12,4.0,2.0, POLISCI4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"He is very laid back and does not make the class a heavy burden. If you go to class you should do well. Class can get boring often, which is why people skip. Textbook readings are unnecessary but outside readings appear on tests. Three exams (non-cumulative) and a paper. Exams are MC and short answer and mostly straightforward right off his slides"
13,4.0,3.0, POLS1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Requires decent effort to do well in the class. Weekly quizzes, 1 midterm, 1 non-cumulative final, 1 term paper, extra credit on research survey & weekly discussion. However, the class is enjoyable, and if you can relate the class materials to what's on the news and media, you will do well. Plus, hompson is caring and helpful at times."
14,3.0,2.0, POLISCI4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"The class was fairly easy, though I already had some background knowledge. He posts his lectures from the previous year online so you can skip class and not miss much. Only worth going to class for current events, which do show up on exams. 3 exams and a paper, but no study guides for the exams. Questions can be kind of specific."
15,4.0,4.0, POLI1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Very knowledgable professor, he knows the content well. No way to do well in the class without doing the reading and the lecture. The quizzes can be tough, and the Exams are not easy either. Take advantage of extra credit opportunities because there is no curve, I was a decimal away from an A and couldn't get it. Not bad class, requires effort."
16,2.0,3.0, POLISCI1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Quizzes are  difficult,  require you to watch the lectures AND do the reading. Lectures are incredibly dry. Not really willing to help , all the questions need to be sent to the TA and you need to visit their office hours. Asked at the end of the semester if I could have 0.5% bump because that would allow me to apply for major, got a no."
17,1.0,5.0, POLIS145,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,worse professor ever. never answered my emails when i had questions and put everything off to the TA. everything is timed and now very much time to do it either.
18,5.0,3.0, POLISCI4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"One word: awesome. Prof. Thompson is absolutely hilarious and always presents his lectures very clearly. Readings are not necessary since literally all of the test questions are based off of his lectures/slides. However, grades are based on 3 tests and paper, so don't mess up any of them. Overall, a cool guy with info-packed contents."
19,4.0,2.0, POLISCI4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Hard to focus because he was so attractive. Don't have to do the readings, but look at the abstracts of each one the night before the exam."
20,5.0,3.0, POLISCI4331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,THOMPSON,"Class was useful to attend but not necessary There are a few papers here and there, but mostly the exams are what matters and those are clear cut (exactly what he says in class/ whats on the slides)"
