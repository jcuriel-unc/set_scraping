1,3.0,1.0, PUBHHBP3510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIANNA,NEMETH,"This class is very easy - follow the detailed directions on the homework and you'll do fine, and the tests aren't weighted heavily. I felt like I could have gotten a lot more out of this class, but the material was broad, and the professor was sometimes condescending. Overall, its easy."
2,4.0,3.0, PUBHHBP3510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIANNA,NEMETH,She is really nice and is a good lecturer. There are weekly assignments and she gives great directions and sources to help you complete the assignment. Midterm and Final aren't weighted heavily which is nice for people who are good test takers.
