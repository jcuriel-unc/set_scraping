1,5.0,4.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,Psych of stereotyping and prejudice is an incredibly interesting class and Dr. Fujita is a great professor.  I highly recommend this class.  As for those saying that you have to read every page of the book...yeah that is what you do with a book.  You read the pages. If you're in college you should probably get over that.
2,1.0,5.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"Horrible professor. Teaches with powerpoint and goes WAY too fast to write anything down so make sure you print off the notes.So, if you learn better by writing things down you're screwed. Exams are very difficult for no reason. Must read every page in the book to do well on an exam. Thinks he's fuuny, but isn't."
3,4.0,4.0, PSY375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"This guy went to Harvard and has a great teaching ethic! He is very clear and precise in what he will test on, as long as you read the book and study his notes! Probably one of my favorite professors yet! I suggest going to class everyday in order to get a good grade in the course! I came out with a B!"
4,5.0,3.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"Very dedicated to his subject matter. You can tell that Dr. Fujita lives, breathes and eats social psychology. The class is by no means a walk in the park, but if you read the book in tandem with lectures, you'll do fine. On a side note, he indirectly inspired me to pursue a career in education and research."
5,4.5,4.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"Professor Fujita is a good teacher. He is very clear when presenting the material and is funny at times. He was also very helpful to those who were having a hard time with the material. There are two papers, which were pretty easy, and three exams which were very difficult. 50% of the exam is from the book while 50% is from the lectures. His exams "
6,4.0,4.0, PSY375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"Dr Fujita is fairly smart and humorous. To be honest, the exams are hard compared to other psych exams that I have taken. The lecture is fun but the textbook is so boring! Psychology of prejudice and discrimination is the least psych class that u should choose."
7,4.5,3.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,He is clear in telling students what he expects from them. His exams can be moderately hard if you expect that memorizing things will get you off with a good grade (don?t write note cards prior to exams). Study the concepts from the book and make sure that you revise his lecture notes.
8,4.0,4.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"Papers were easy to write. Reading is boring, but do it. The tests are impossible because it is filled with so many tricks and lures. Even if you go to class, its still hard to get higher then a B with the curve. I would recommend it. the class is interesting. alot of info to be absorbed. fujita is a good professor."
9,5.0,4.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"I'm not a psych major, and I didn't really think there would be a lot to learn about in this class since the topic is so narrow. Man was I wrong! Dr. Fujita knows his stuff and makes it very easy to learn all of the material. His tests are tough, but not impossible. There are TONS of theories to learn and lots of reading to do in order to pass."
10,4.5,2.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"Very interesting class. He's a great teacher. The book is necessary. It is not a hard read, just dry. But you must read to get a good grade for this class. Tests are 50% lecture/ 50% book. Two papers, but easy to write. I would suggest this teacher for this class. He is easy to understand and willing to answer any questions. Quick to e-mail back."
11,5.0,3.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"I took this class in sp 08. Don't know what the big deal is why people are saying it was hard. You have to read the book!!!! A lot of the test questions come from the book, also I suggest printing the notes before coming to class it helps a lot. I got  90% on all my exams and the avg. was in the 60% range. Do what ur suppose to do and ull get an A!"
12,4.5,5.0, PSYCH520,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"This class is hard.  It's a lot of work.  But if you're getting a B.S. you have to take a class like this to graduate, and I suggest taking this one because social psych is interesting."
13,3.5,4.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"Going to class helps out a lot and a lot of questions are from the textbook and not discussed in class.  He is very clear in lecture on what he expects.  On the two short essays, follow EXACTLY. If you deviate or try to go ""above and beyond"" he will FAIL YOU!"
14,1.5,5.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,DO NOT take his class
15,3.0,5.0, PSYCH475,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,Psychology is my major and this class made me question whether or not I wanted to do it. He made the tests way too difficult and gave us a curve because most of the class did poorly. The only reason I passed was because of the good curve!
16,4.0,4.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"He was great. Exams were difficult, but there was a nice curve. I thoroughly enjoyed his class, and hope to take 520 with him as well."
17,2.0,5.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,fujita sucks. get another professor if you can. his tests are way too hard. it's like he enjoys watching you suffer through the exams. don't say i didn't warn you.
18,3.5,5.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KENTARO,FUJITA,"he talks way too fast and he likes to make his tests ridiculously hard.. like to the point where it's just unnecessary. READ YOUR BOOK; he likes to screw you over with questions from the readings. don't memorize definitions, but be able to understand the concepts and how they're applied. attendance isn't mandatory since he puts slides on carmen."
