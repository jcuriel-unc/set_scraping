2,5.0,3.0, PUBHEPI5411,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,MILLER,"Bill is both a great guy and a great professor. He is a certified genius in his field but doesn't come off as a know it all. He cares a lot about both the course content and his students and wants you to do well while actually learning. The outbreak investigation is a good amount of work, but that hard and actually pretty fun overall."
