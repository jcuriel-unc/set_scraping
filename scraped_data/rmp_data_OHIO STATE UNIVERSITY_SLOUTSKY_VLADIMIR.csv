1,1.0,3.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,SLOUTSKY,"Avoid this professor like the plague. This is my first time rating a professor and its because I do not want other students to have to suffer through this mans horribly boring, monotone lectures. His syllabus and organization of class is all over the place. I passed with a B but that is solely because the exams were open note."
2,1.0,2.0, PSYCH3550H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,SLOUTSKY,"He was nice, but this class was so annoying and terrible. He stood and spoke for 80 minutes and was occasionally asked questions. Exams and pop quizzes were open note, but had stuff we had never seen before. Writing a paper every day and summarizing each class was redundant and not helpful. Lots of extra credit, but this class was so tedious"
3,1.0,3.0, PSYCH3550H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,SLOUTSKY,"He's a nice guy, so I feel bad rating him poorly, but he does not know how to structure a class. His lectures just read off the slides, his tests are unreasonably difficult and he doesn't give enough time given the number of questions, his assignments are unclear, and he doesn't explain them. And we had to read and write a paper for every class."
4,1.0,2.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,SLOUTSKY,"Sloutsky uses a grading set up that baffles me as to why he thought it was reasonable. two exams total, but the mid-semester exam is worth 90 points (80 minutes to take) and the final is 120 point cumulative (105 minutes to take). When I emailed him he responded with little thought or effort much like his in person lectures. Please spare yourself."
5,1.0,3.0, PSYCH3550H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,SLOUTSKY,"I feel so bad giving Vlad a bad grade. However, Vlad simply talks for an hour and twenty minutes straight right off the slides, and he doesn't know how to structure the class. His pop quizzes and exams, while open note, have things on them I've never heard of before. In class, everyone looks at one another in confusion. Avoid him if you can."
6,4.0,2.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,SLOUTSKY,"The lecture is kinda boring but Dr. Sloutsky does work hard to teach it. He covers tons of experiments and great ideas. This class also push me to read journals that I might have never read and I learn a lot from those. Tests are OPEN BOOK + 55 extra credits, so you can't complain for anything! Also, he is really patient and always ready to help."
7,2.5,1.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,SLOUTSKY,"Sloutsky can't teach and his lectures are incredibly boring. At the end of every class you have to turn in a paragraph summary for attendance so you have to go. He does offer a ton of extra credit though and the tests are open book, open note, open computer! He also can be kinda rude. He will put you down if your opinion is not the same as his."
8,3.5,1.0, PSYCH3550H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,SLOUTSKY,"This guy reeks of insecurity. At every chance he gets he tries to uphold the validity of psychology and puts down anyone who challenges anything in his class. He is really, really condescending if your answer to a question in class isn't what he's looking for (even if it's right). That being said, this class is a SUPER easy A, but lots of busywork."
9,3.0,2.0, PSYCH3550H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,SLOUTSKY,"Sometimes the class could be a little dull, but overall it was pretty easy. You have to summarize a lot of academic  journals, but you can do an extra six and get sixty extra credit points! which is aaaaawesome. There were two separate final projects and a final exam, but both exams are multiple choice and the projects aren't difficult"
