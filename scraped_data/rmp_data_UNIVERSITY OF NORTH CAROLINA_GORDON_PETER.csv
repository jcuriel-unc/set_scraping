1,5.0,2.0, NSCI225H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PETER,GORDON,"Straightforward class. You can either pay attention in class and briefly skim the textbook for what he didn't cover or zone out in class and read. Either way, the exams are non-cumulative and 70/30 multiple choice/short answer. MC isn't confusing and short answer has lenient grading. Dr. Gordon uses really dry humor in class but it's amusing."
2,3.0,4.0, PSCY330,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PETER,GORDON,"Professor Gordon seems like a nice guy and he sprinkles jokes into his lectures here and there, but the content for this class felt like a slog to get through. Additionally, it felt as though it was difficult to glean information from the slides when reviewing for exams. One of the more boring courses I've had here. Take it only if you need it."
3,4.0,2.0, NSCI225H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PETER,GORDON,"He's a good professor. Very monotonous during his lectures. Never paid attention in class and got an A. As long as you do the readings and the participation assignments, you'll be fine. He's funny but the online format made it harder to wanna pay attention."
4,5.0,2.0, PSYC330,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PETER,GORDON,"Most of the time, I didn't know too much about what was going on in class. He gives you a study guide, and those are pretty spot on and I usually learn the material best from those and finding other resources explaining things better. The projects are fine IF you have good group members, or else they will be a PAIN."
5,2.0,2.0, PSYC330,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PETER,GORDON,Such a boring class and no clear structure for teaching (bunch of rambling). Idk if I'm just dumb but I did not really comprehend the readings or many of the concepts. I did not really go to class or sufficiently read the readings and did fine. Annoying projects but just do the assignments and you can get a good grade
6,5.0,3.0, NSCI225H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PETER,GORDON,Dr. Gordon is awesome! He is accessible outside of class and his tests are manageable if you study. Definitely recommend this professor!
7,4.0,4.0, PSYC330,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PETER,GORDON,"He's a great guy, however his tests are some of the worst I've ever taken at UNC. I had an A average for everything else, but failed both of his tests along with about half of the class. It might have been that the TA was just heartless, bc it seems as though he doesn't make his tests. Other than that, he will work with you if you need help"
8,5.0,3.0, PSYC225H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PETER,GORDON,"Dr. Gordon is a cool guy! I do find his class a bit typical of honors classes in the fact that they are small and grading can be a bit of mystery. Nonetheless, it was not hard to get an A in the end, but throughout the semester I was never sure if it would end up that way!"
9,5.0,2.0, PSYC330,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PETER,GORDON,My favorite professor at UNC. His lectures are very interesting and he has a good sense of humor. The exams are also fairly straightforward and easy if you study.
10,5.0,2.0, PSYC225H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,PETER,GORDON,Peter Gordon is GREAT! I loved taking sensation and perception with him! He is older and has a slightly monotone voice but will still keep your attention during lecture. He has a witty sense of humor and wants to keep the class involved during participation assignments (read & discuss article). Exams are straightforward.
