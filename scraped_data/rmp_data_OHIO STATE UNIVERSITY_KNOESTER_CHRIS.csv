1,4.0,2.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"Although this class was structured weird, with pretty much the entire grade depending on a midterm, final paper, and final exam, Professor Knoester is really great. Very knowledgable and passionate about what he teaches and keeps lectures engaging through funny videos and games. Genuinely cares for the wellbeing and success of his students. "
2,5.0,2.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,This call was Definity a reading heavy class because a lot of the topics covered in class had excerpts to read. If you read them and take note you will do amazing. The exams are written and all the stuff can be turned in on the last day of class. So what you give is what you get. A great teacher really cares but is kinda boring at times.
3,3.0,4.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"Very understanding prof during Covid as he did not have deadlines for homework/exams. However, he assigned many random assignments/papers, and the midterm is a 10-page paper. The class also has a very unclear/confusing research project (5 pages) worth 15% of grade. Lectures are also extremely boring."
4,3.0,2.0, SOCIO101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"Pretty straightforward class. Brings unbiased, thorough discussion material class. Has students think for themselves a lot. Lots of effort points. Basically everyone opts to take the essay option for exams which is 2 essays you can prepare outlines for ahead of time. Can be a bit passive-aggressive at times. Decent extra credit at the end."
5,3.0,3.0, SOC4655,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,This class was pretty easy if you've taken Sociology courses before. The debates and debate notes were not hard to complete just annoying busy work. The exams were fair. Discussion in class could be frustrating at times but overall the class was not bad.
6,4.0,3.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"Chris was very good at keeping his teaching unbiased. Although people disagree a lot when it comes to sociology, he didn't try to convince us to adopt his views.  Class isn't hard if you attend and if you keep on top of work."
7,2.0,3.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"Very boring lecture. Very vague and confusing with his lecture. Didn't really learn anything. Overall, easy grader and nice but horrible professor."
8,1.0,5.0, 4655,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"He is one of the worst professors at OSU, the exams are impossible and when you miss class you have to write a paper when in class they took a half page of notes."
9,2.5,5.0, SOC4655,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"a HUGE amount of work for zero payoff. If you miss a class for any  reason you can ""make up"" a missed in-class assignment by writing a 3-5 page paper. He adds projects which are not listed on the syllabus and only allows a few days before they are due, so if you miss a class you also miss assigned papers. "
10,4.0,2.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"Dr. Knoester's class wasn't difficult and he is an extremely nice person.  I just wanted to comment to warn that if you want to get excited about Sociology, this is not the professor to take.  His lectures were so hard to sit through.  Don't bother buying the textbook, but you need the reader!  Take the essay version of the exams."
11,3.5,2.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"The class is relatively easy with only two exams (take the essay versions and you can bring in outlines on the day of the exam). There's in-class activities for a grade, so you have to show up to class. The lectures are a little boring, but overall the class is an easy A. "
12,4.0,2.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"Not a bad class overall but rather boring lectures for 1hr 20mins. Only two exams (midterm and final)- choose the essay exam! The rest is in-class activities (graded for completion) so show up to class plus a few things outside of class. Only buy the reader, not the other text! Sometimes lectures are fun when he plays movies and clips from colbert!"
13,3.5,4.0, SOC4655,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,OMG the class was overrated. There were 2 exams (Midterm & Final) he definitely took the fun out of the class. I think it could have been better but he made it horrible. I wouldn't recommend this class because it doesn't matter how hard you work on the debate notes. You're going to get a LAME GRADE!
14,5.0,2.0, SOC4655,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"In-class participation assignments are used as an attendance-taking tool. Other than that, there was only 1 easy midterm and three very relaxed debates. Overall, the class consists of open discussions, basic Powerpoint slides, and relevant documentaries/clips. Chris is genuinely great guy, and his love for teaching is extremely evident."
15,4.0,2.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"Knoester is special in that he is smart and knows what he's talking about and he's good at teaching. Make sure to take notes on the reader as you go, it will make your life a lot easier around midterms and finals. He doesn't give tests, only two essay exams and a project."
16,3.5,1.0, SOC1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"I took the Honors version of the course, easy A. He takes participation credit sometimes but you'll get it if you're there. No need for the Henslin book, you only need the reader. Sit back, survive the lecture and this class is a breeze. He's extremely knowledgeable on the subject, just not the most exciting."
17,2.0,4.0, SOCI101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,don't take his class if you are not a native speaker.
18,4.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"Easy class. Don't bother buying the textbook. Buy the reader and take notes from it because you need to site it in the midterm and final exam essays. Nice professor, but boring class."
19,3.0,3.0, SOCIO1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"Class is almost interesting, completely lecture.  He assigns two books, but only uses the reader.  He is a smart guy and understand the subject well.  Take the full essay format exams- way easier"
20,4.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRIS,KNOESTER,"I took the honors version. Great class and super easy. Only need the reader, don't waste time purchasing textbook. Midterm and final are essays that you get to make outlines for and use on the test. Kinda boring but easy GEC."
