1,5.0,4.0, PHIL698,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDRA,OPREA,Prof. Oprea is the real deal. Highly recommend.
2,5.0,4.0, PHIL384,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDRA,OPREA,"Professor Oprea is an excellent and clear presenenter! She gives great feedback and is happy to discuss concepts outside of lecture. There's a significant amount of reading that is necessary if you want to do well, as she has high expectations for essays. However, if you do the readings and participate in class, you will be prepared."
3,5.0,3.0, POLI472,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDRA,OPREA,"Professor Oprea is a great professor. For this class there was a lot of reading at at times it was really heavy. Everyday she put us into discussion groups, where we talked and then presented our ideas, which she counted as participation. She was incredibly helpful in office hours and honestly just great to chat with. Highly recommend her!"
4,3.0,3.0, PHIL384,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDRA,OPREA,"Definitely a respected professor and she really is passionate about it, which helps. She knows the material really well. However, the lectures are often pretty mundane and sometimes she runs the risk of over complicating things. Not a hard class, do the readings and youll be fine. Youll like this class if youre really into PPE."
5,5.0,4.0, PHIL384,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDRA,OPREA,"Oprea is an amazing teacher that delivers well worded and organized lectures. Yes, some of the material may be a bit dry but she presents the information in a concise and understandable manner. Class attendance is paramount to getting a good grade on the take home exams and for understanding the material."
6,2.0,3.0, ECON384,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDRA,OPREA,"Boring and unhelpful lectures, but pretty easy class. When she explains things, she tries to use as unnecessary and complicated a vernacular as possible. The readings are actually easier to comprehend without her explaining them, and I just kept my AirPods in every class and managed to get an A by doing all the learning myself. Shes nice tho!"
7,5.0,3.0, PHIL698,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDRA,OPREA,Professor Oprea's class required a lot of reading but all of them were interesting and relevant. The class had some lecture but mostly centered around debate which made the 3 hour long class bearable. Professor Oprea is very helpful and clearly very passionate about PPE.
8,5.0,3.0, PHIL384,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDRA,OPREA,"Professor Oprea is extremely knowledgeable about all of the topics we discussed in class. She makes you think and argue for philosophies or theories you don't necessarily agree on, but I find that valuable. I think that she also is a fair grader."
9,5.0,3.0, ECON384,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDRA,OPREA,"Alexa is a very effective lecturer, and was always careful to explore philosophical, political, and economic implications during lectures. Course consisted of a game theory quiz and three take-home essay exams. My only gripe would be a relative lack of feedback, but she is accessible outside of class. Look forward to taking the capstone with her!"
10,5.0,3.0, PHIL384,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDRA,OPREA,"This course solidified my intent to pursue PPE. Despite being new, Prof Oprea is by far the most eloquent and effective lecturer I've ever had. She is fully deserving of a teaching award, and I will definitely take her again."
11,5.0,3.0, PHIL698,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDRA,OPREA,Very good professor. Cares about students and is very helpful outside of class.
