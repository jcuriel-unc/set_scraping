1,3.0,5.0, PSYC58H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"Not an easy A. This class is incredibly intensive and although she has high expectations for honors students, she's really accessible during office hours. She's passive-aggressive, and getting feedback from her outside of assignments is hard. Get ready to write a lot; many small and group assignments with a 10+ page research paper at the end. "
2,4.0,3.0, PSYC58H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"This class was VERY boring. Dr. Arnold is fine, but she is definitely more of a research professor than a teaching professor. The last bit of this class was a research project, and she was very helpful with that. This class is not an easy A, but it isn't terribly hard. If you don't want to be bored and hate your FYS, don't take this class."
3,4.0,4.0, PSYC438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"I had extenuating circumstances this semester and would not have passed this class without Dr. Arnold's help. She cared about my success in her class and reached out often to make sure I stayed on top of the class. She grades intensely, but I do think her feedback is super helpful. She really showed tough love, which I deeply respect. "
4,1.0,4.0, PSYC438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"Do not take a class with her. Her grading standards are incredibly harsh and she gives very vague instructions for all assignments. She is very disorganized and has no idea how to use technology, she was not even able to post quizzes on Sakai without there being serious glitches. She is a researcher, not a teacher. "
5,1.0,4.0, PSYC438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,I hate this class. 
6,1.0,4.0, PSYC438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"Class does not teach about language, it teaches about research. If I wanted to learn about research, I would have taken that class again. Lectures are super dry and she's completely unorganized, does class work out of order, and does not know how to communicate. -10/10 Do not recommend."
7,1.0,4.0, PSYC438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"Horrible lecturer. Doesn't teach or answer questions well. Course content is painfully dry. She's disorganized, constantly contradicting herself, and has no idea how to use technology. Assignment instructions are vague and confusing. She's an overall atrocious communicator and is so out of touch with her students. DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER!!!!!!"
8,1.0,4.0, PSYC490,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"She is so dumb!! Absolutely no help in class, unreachable, extremely rude, her presence infuriates everyone. Makes you question her phd's cause she is not good in her field. Super disorganized. UNC has some questionable profs in general, but she doesn't deserve to be one here. Class is easy-but theres a lot of effort. She wouldn't round at the end."
9,3.0,4.0, PSYC438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"Nice but very intense and direct. Gives specific feedback on writing, doesn't grade lightly. Pays attention to every detail. Sometimes belabors points but generally has clear grading criteria. I am a little scared of her. She is very smart. You can't BS your way through writing. She will literally read all of it to make sure it makes sense."
10,2.0,5.0, PSYCH438,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"This class was a huge disappointment. Lots of readings and homework, rubrics, and criteria for assignments were incredibly vague. Also, she is a really tough grader for someone whose teaching skills are so average. Don't take this class."
11,4.0,3.0, PSYC490,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,Dr. Arnold is very passionate and knowledgable about the subject. Her criteria for each assignment was clear and she graded fairly. There was a research component to the class that was not only fun but also informative. Assigned readings and some lectures could be confusing but she was always quick to clarify anything people had questions about
12,2.0,4.0, PSYC432,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"Just don't. I wish I would have taken a different upper level Psychology class. She is a very tough grader, yet not a great lecturer. Easy to conflict with her personality/style. Uses a bell curve for grades."
13,1.0,5.0, PSYC432,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"Do not take this class, very boring and she grades very very tough. You will read about 60 pages every week and get a quiz on that before class starts every class."
14,3.0,5.0, PSYC432,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"She is a good professor and really like the subject she is teaching. BUT She is a very very tough grader like she wants everything to be perfect. She gives research article summary assignments and expects you to use all of your words and nothing from the paper which makes no sense, because you have to talk about conditions and all. Not recommended."
15,4.0,1.0, PSYC58H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"Professor Arnold is very invested in her class and subject material.  Sometimes her lectures are not the most interesting, but we did our own research and she helped a lot, making the course very worthwhile.  Easy A, not a heavy work load, just have to make sure you get your work done."
16,3.0,2.0, PSYC58H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,Dr. Arnold's PSYC 58 seminar is quite easy. A nice teacher but could be a boringbad lecturer.
17,5.0,2.0, PSYC58,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"She was a good teacher. I had her for a FYS. It was my highest grade, and my easiest class my first semester of my first year. Great teacher! Nice lady! Cool class! Thumbs up."
18,4.5,3.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,"I loved this class! Her lectures were usually engaging, and I thought she did a good job of explaining the sometimes confusing concepts. Lots of tests = each test covered less material, each test not worth as much = better grades. Challenging yet interesting class - one of my favorites so far at UNC."
19,4.5,2.0, COGNATIVEPSYCH,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JENNIFER,ARNOLD,multiple choice part of test not as difficult as essay.  Tends to run out of time.  Will help you if you approach her.  Textbook v. boring
