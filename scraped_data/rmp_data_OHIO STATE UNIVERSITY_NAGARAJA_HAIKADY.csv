1,2.5,4.0, STAT421,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HAIKADY,NAGARAJA,"Kind of a hard class. The second midterm was really hard for most students, but he ended up curving the class in the end. He didn't do a great job of teaching the material for the second midterm, and the TA's weren't very helpful when we asked questions about the material either. In the end it worked out, but still a tough class to get through."
