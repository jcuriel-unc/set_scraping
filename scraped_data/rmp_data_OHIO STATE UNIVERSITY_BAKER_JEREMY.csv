1,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEREMY,BAKER,"Prof. Baker is the most grounded and personable professor I've ever had. I have ADHD and I can confidently say that his lectures are amazingly engaging, I've never been bored in his class. He exudes so much passion through his lectures that it's frankly hard to not do well in his class. Overall, one of the best learning experiences in my life. "
2,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEREMY,BAKER,"I had Professor Baker twice for 2 different classes, 1101 and 3460. Both times he was very enjoyable to have. He is very knowledgeable about the material that is given and the classes were both very interesting but you need to come to class and be ready to learn. Highly recommend having him."
