2,5.0,2.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KELLY,GIOVANELLO,"Dr. G is a really great professor. Attendance is not mandatory, but it helps to go to class. All PowerPoints are posted online. Her tests are all short answer, but she provides a study guide with the exact questions a week before. There are two five page papers, which are graded relatively easy by the TAs. Also, there are 10 easy online assignments"
