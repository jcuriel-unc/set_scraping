1,4.0,3.0, POLISCI4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"It's hard to fully judge him based off the circumstances with switching to online classes, but this class was really interesting and I learned a lot. It required a lot of reading with daily reading quizzes, but it is very heavily curved to make up for the difficulty. I recommend it to anyone interested, but definitely requires some effort!"
2,2.0,4.0, POLITSC3780,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"Do not take 3780! They ""teach"" you with YouTube videos that are all four years out of date! Recitation is basically just graduate students trying to help you with all the problems you'll inevitably encounter, again, because they don't teach you! The videos weren't even made for this course, they're recycled from another! BEYOND LAZY!"
3,4.0,3.0, POLSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"Initially, this class was extremely hard. However, once I got the hang of the style of quizzes and exams, it wasn't bad at all. There is a MAJOR curve (currently 80% and above is an A), and Braumoeller and the TA's understand you are in other classes. I have never taken a political science class before and I learned many things about war and data."
4,4.0,1.0, POLISCI3780,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"Weekly assignments due, and he teaches you how to complete them on his lectures that are available on iTunes. You don't have to go to class unless you're struggling and need help. I managed to figure out how to do all of the assignments without showing up to class or asking for help and get an A. Very nice guy, very understanding as well."
5,4.0,3.0, 3780,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"Assignments every week. Project due at the end of the semester.  Professor very helpful in class and through email. Material can be challenging. Class is useful though. Learned how to find data, scrape websites for data, use a number of tools to analyze data, and operate a statistical programming environment named R. Would recommend to a friend"
6,5.0,1.0, POLS4781,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,Amazing professor.
7,5.0,4.0, POLS4781,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"Took this prof for Poli Sci 4781, which fulfills QR requirement. He told us at the beginning that he was changing it from stats to data visualization. He messed up a few things but it's a new class and he admitted mistakes and apologized (rare!). HIGHLY recommend the class: still hard but actually USEFUL. Prof was cool and funny."
8,4.5,4.0, POLS544,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"The books and material are challenging, but his lectures are great and he gives you lots of ways to absorb the material (lecture, section, online lecture slides). Really not a hard class if you do the reading."
9,4.0,3.0, PSCI544,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,Class was interesting; prof has a great sense of humor (and the best name ever).  Midterm and final aren't as impossible as everyone's saying; I didn't do any of the readings (didn't even buy the books) and I got a B+ in the class.  Just pay attention in recitation and you should pick up the book material.
10,4.5,2.0, INTST201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"Going into it I had no idea how the classes would be, but he made each one more interesting than the previous. He has a good sense of humor, but is still serious enough that all the work gets finished. There is a lot of reading and the lectures can go fast, but overall its not too hard."
11,3.5,2.0, POLSC544,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"There are an insane amount of readings assigned, and they're the key to passing the multiple choice section of exams. He comes off as slightly pretentious, but he makes lecture fun to listen to. It's a lot of material, but a decent curve, mixed with a paper that takes a large chunk of the grade as well as mandatory recitation."
12,4.0,4.0, PS544,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"One of the best professors I've ever had. Lecture is terse, but very well-structured and you'll learn more in half an hour with him than many professors can in a quarter. Exams are challenging, so study well. Lectures are very fun as well, and usually include video or audio clips to keep things interesting."
13,4.0,5.0, PS544,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"Lectures are actually really interesting and well put together, but he is pretty arrogant (though funny sometimes). Tests are VERY hard and totally unrealistic. TA said there were a lot of grad school questions on midterm. HAVE to do reading to know what the tests are talking about. I wouldn't take him again, just because tests are impossible."
14,4.0,4.0, PSCI544,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,"Bear is the funniest professor I have ever had, and every lecture was interesting and got everyone thinking and involved.  I highly recommend Bear and this course.  He literally had the whole room cracking up.  Driest sense of humor ever.  Plus, I cannot stress how insanely cool the name ""Bear"" is."
15,2.0,5.0, POLIS585,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BEAR,BRAUMOELLER,Bear was pretty arrogant. His lectures could be fairly entertaining but he was constantly unclear as to what was required.
