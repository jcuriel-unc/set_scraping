1,5.0,3.0, SOC5925,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BELLAIR,"Dr. Bellair is an excellent professor. He really cares about his student's success. His course is very well-organized and he does as much as he can to make a course of this difficulty accessible to his students. The only note was some of the readings were really long, over 100 pages, and could have easily been assigned with only the abstract."
2,3.5,2.0, SOC3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BELLAIR,"Very, very boring lectures. Stays on the same slide for an hour. Attendance does matter because you do writing assignments in each class. Very boring and drawn out talks but easy class. Tests aren't too bad as long as you study. "
3,3.0,3.0, SOC4611,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BELLAIR,"Overall a pretty easy class if you do the readings and attend class to complete critical thinking written assignments (1-2 paragraphs). Lectures are extremely boring. I think this class could be really interesting if taught by a different professor. If you want to attend jailprison tours, don't schedule class after this one. "
4,3.5,2.0, SOC3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BELLAIR,"Overall solid professor. Class can seem a bit slow at times and he isn't the best with powerpoint, but he certainly knows his stuff. If you attend class, pay attention, and do the in class writings, it's hard to get a bad grade. Exams are easy, and he look like Tobias from Arrested Development without a mustache. Solid dude"
5,2.0,3.0, SOC3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BELLAIR,Boring. Bad use of powerpoint.
6,4.0,2.0, SOC3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BELLAIR,I actually enjoyed this class with Professor Bellair.  His exams are pretty easy as long as you read the chapters and attend class.  Complete the critical thinking questions and it is hard to get a bad grade in this class.  He knows what he's talking about and invites you on jail visits with his higher level classes! I'd take a class with him again
7,1.5,4.0, SOC3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BELLAIR,"Extremely boring teacher, speaks mono-tone the whole time. Makes harder to understand than it should be."
8,2.0,3.0, CRIM410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BELLAIR,"The previous two post say it well. He stands in front of the class and simply lectures from the book, he's more than boring, and he makes the class harder than it needs to be. He does provide his slides but not until a couple days before the test. He gives absolutely NO review and you're on your own for the tests. Very disappointed in this teacher."
9,1.5,4.0, SOC410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BELLAIR,"He is unresponsive to e-mails if you need to miss class, so you don't even know if he received them. He doesn't give out study guides. He says read the chapters assigned & study the slides which are like 80 slides. He doesn't post the ppts before hand so you give up taking notes. He says you can arrange to change your final if needed but doesn't."
10,3.5,2.0, CRIM410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BELLAIR,3 MC tests. Seemed to stretch for material on a few of the questions. Lectures were pretty boring. Had 1-3 opinion questions that you had to hand in at the end of each class. Just hand in something and you are good. These were worth a solid % of the grade and worth the effort.
