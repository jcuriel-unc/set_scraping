1,2.0,2.0, POLITSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,"This class is ok. Gelpi was rarely on time, impossible to reach, and overall disorganized. I only got an A in the class because of all the extra credit (4 pts for SEIS, and 4 pts for attendance). I didn't learn anything, which made writing a 12-page research paper difficult. The TAs grade them though so you'll get an A even if your paper is awful

2,5.0,1.0, 4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,"Great professor! Really cares about students. Easy grader, if you think something was misgraded you can ask to change it.

Not many assignments and they are easy and you'll learn. Few small assignments for participation, 2 exams (easy), 1 final paper that is broken up throughout semester. Plus he brings his dog!"
3,5.0,2.0, 4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,Dr.Gelpi is very passionate about what he teaches and it definitely shows. He is willing to answer questions and help students succeed. He explains everything in detail and keep us entertained.
4,5.0,2.0, POLITSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,Lectures are sometimes boring but if you pay attention and take notes in lecture you'll do well on the exams. Reading quizzes are not hard because he goes over reading materials during lecture so even if you don't actually read you'll still get full points on the quizzes.
5,5.0,2.0, POLITSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,Pretty easy class while still learning a lot. Gelpi is a really good story teller so his lectures are pretty interesting. The review sessions before the midterm and final covered everything and the paper is broken down so its not very hard.
6,4.0,3.0, POLITSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,"Attendance counts as extra credit & he brings a dog. Lectures are extremely boring. Second half of class after the midterm is more interesting. Paper is broken into parts so no stress to put all together. Exams are easy, he gives you a study guide & just know what he says. Hard to reach out of class. Quizzes are easy. Boring, but easy A."
7,4.0,3.0, POLITSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,"Professor Gelpi is great! Nicest dude, really knows his stuff, very good lecturer. Hard to get a hold of sometimes, though."
8,5.0,1.0, POLITSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,"I showed up to class 5 times the whole semester; the midterm, to turn in the different parts of the paper, and the final. You don't need to show up. He gives a study guide for the midterm and final and they are multiple choice. It was super easy and minimal time was put in out of class besides the paper."
9,3.0,4.0, POLITSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,"Exams were tough. Paper has no clear grading criteria so its hard to know whats expected for a sizable chunk if your grade. Interesting guy, interesting topics, but be cautious with this class."
10,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,Really nice guy and he really wants you to do well. Very clear and interesting lecturer but also puts everything online. The paper was over a long period of time and in section so it guarantees a good grade. And the final exam was the easiest thing I have ever taken in college I was shocked. Highly recommend. (He also brings dogs to class!)
11,4.0,3.0, PS4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,"Prof. Gelpi lectures in a very understanding manner. His lectures are pretty basic and they are not hard to follow. Grading comprised of 1 midterm, 1 final, quizzes, and a final paper. Readings are not necessary and they are all available on Canvas. I highly recommend taking his class. Test grades are weighted quite heavily, so be sure to study!"
12,5.0,1.0, POLITICAL,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,He is awesome 
13,4.5,3.0, 4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,"Political science isn't exactly my strongest subject, but this was wasn't horribly difficult. If you really understand political science, the lectures probably aren't necessary. The information is all on the powerpoints, but I thought some of his lectures were really interesting. Tests were fair, and study guides were given out before each one. "
14,4.0,2.0, PS4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,"Dr. Gelpi is a good professor and is very willing to help students. His only downfall is that he has a tendency to lecture directly from his powerpoint slides. This class is not hard, if you find PS4315 difficult and are studying polysci  int studies  you should probably change your major. "
15,3.0,3.0, POLITSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,"I learned shockingly little new information in class. Like, shockingly. Readings were helpful occasionally, but Dr. Gelpi spent most of his time in lectures rewording his slides so it sounded like he wasn't just reading from them. So not bad information necessarily, just horrendously, horrendously boring. "
16,3.5,4.0, PS4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,GELPI,"He is very boring and the lecture is just what's on the sides, there really isn't reason to go to class especially since the TA does all the grading and comments. Also the exams are very short. 3 ID terms and 2 essays, missing one brings the exam down, and with only 3 grades , midterm, final, and paper its do or die.  Avoid this class and teacher!"
