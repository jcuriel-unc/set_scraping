1,4.0,1.0, SOCI251,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,"Dr. Pearce was very kind and understanding! The class was easy - lectures were pretty stale and often avoidable if you took notes from the textbook readings, midterms were online, and assignments could be low-effort. Hardest part was the final research report, but Dr. Pearce sets up assignments to make it easier!"
2,3.0,3.0, SOCI129,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,"This class had relatively interesting material, but the class was beyond boring. There were 6 units and for each unit, you took the quizzes, did assignments, and watched lectures alone and then met as a class to review. Im the end we only had class 6 times. Quizzes are the hardest part of the class."
3,4.0,2.0, SOCI251,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,"Professor Pearce is super nice and helpful! I had issues with a group project and she made sure the project was graded on individual work by sending out group evaluation forms! There are quizzes for every chapter, 2 exams, a couple assignments and a final group research poster! The lectures are pretty boring because the content isnt that exciting"
4,4.0,2.0, SOCI251,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,"If you know the main concepts for the different topics, you should be okay on the exams. They are straight forward. There's a group project that happens throughout the semester but it isn't that bad."
5,5.0,1.0, SOCI251,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,"Dr. Pearce is very passionate about what she teaches. She is also very accommodating to her students. Her class is very easy. Attendance is not mandatory as I never came to class and also, never studied for a single exam yet still got an A-. Definitely recommend taking courses with her."
6,4.0,2.0, SOCI429,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,"A great class if you love reading sociology books and then discussing them in class. Lots of reading but I thought it was doable for meeting twice a week. The research project we did involved going to churches in the area and taking fieldnotes about what happened, we then wrote a group paper about our research."
7,1.0,2.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,The course material is very interesting but the most boring professor I've ever had. She usually doesn't talk about anything of relevance to the course but uses confusing graphs the entire lecture. I learned more from reading the book and teaching myself the content.
8,3.0,3.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,"The lectures are unnecessarily slow and boring. The material is pretty easy to follow as long as you do the readings and listen in class but the tests are a little difficult. The assignments are easy. Overall, the material is interesting and the class is low maintenance."
9,3.0,2.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,"Interesting content, but she gives VERY dry lectures. Should be an easy A if you keep up with the reading and take notes. Some test questions and short writing assignment prompts are unclear or confusing which can be frustrating. Despite this, she is very nice and cares a lot about her research which she ties into course content."
10,1.0,4.0, SOCI429,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,"She was unprepared, failed to tie material together, makes students work harder than we learn or get back from the class, arbitrary and unnecessarily tough grader. Worst class I have taken. Frustrating and felt like a waste of time"
11,4.0,2.0, SOCI251,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,"She is very dry.  Her lectures go so slowly, but her class is easy.  She is passionate about research and very nice."
12,5.0,3.0, SOCI251,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LISA,PEARCE,"Class is heavy on lectures and a bit dry at times but not too hard. Easy to succeed if you do the reading and ask questions in class. Lots of opportunities to get help if you need it, she is very accommodating."
