2,4.0,2.0, PHILOS2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, PIERS NORRIS,TURNER,Great class to take. Very engaging in lectures. Papers are not too difficult as long as you follow his instructions. Tests are very easy if you read the required material and actually engage in lecture.
3,3.0,3.0, PHILOS2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, PIERS NORRIS,TURNER,"Piers is great at making Philosophy interesting and engaging, and often crafts his lectures around group conversation and participation. The only downside is that it can feel disorganized and like its on you to figure out what to study, rather than any clear criteria. If you show up to class and read the material, you should be just fine!"
