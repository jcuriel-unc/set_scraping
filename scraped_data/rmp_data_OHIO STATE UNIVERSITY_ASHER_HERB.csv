1,5.0,3.0, POL4162,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Show up, pay attention, the lectures are in depth but you will learn so much from him.  When working on the paper, go to him he will you the feedback you need to pass.  He is a great teacher."
2,5.0,3.0, POLSC506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Asher is really one of the best at OSU.  His tests are tough but fair, the paper is easy if you follow his instructions and go to him for help, and the reading isn't really necessary.  The guy is absolutely brilliant and knows an unbelievable amount about OH politics, you will learn a ton!"
3,4.5,3.0, PS506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Having your Ohio Politics class taught by Presdident Gee's Senior Political Advisor is pretty darn awesome! Definitely attend lectures, as Asher has plenty of insightful stories and experience on the subject matter. A TON of reading, but most was relevant and helpful on exams. Attendance, studying and reading are all necessary for an A!"
4,5.0,2.0, PS502,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Prof Asher is a very good lecturer. The class is a typical poli sci class, with two midterms that are essay based. Recitation is used to explore interesting topics. Also, there is a requirement to volunteer for a campaign 6-10 hours a week, with a paper due at the end of the quarter. Would definitely recommend prof Asher."
5,5.0,1.0, PS502,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Excellent.  His lectures are very interesting, and he is really laid-back.  You have to work for six hours per week with a campaign of your choice and write an essay about it.  Do not buy the textbooks; you will never even look at them."
6,4.5,4.0, PS506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"I thought Dr. Asher's Ohio Politics class was outstanding.  He's the best professor I've had at the university thusfar.  And no, it's not impossible to get an A in his class."
7,5.0,2.0, POLI502,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Great Prof!! Very entertaining, and very personable. He's biased, and doesn't try to hide it, but will like you no matter your opinions as long as you share your opinions. We barely used the textbooks, and the exams weren't bad if you paid attention in class. I learned a lot in this class!"
8,3.5,2.0, PS502,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Independents and third-party supporters beware: this guy often confuses facts with opinions, whether or not his students realize it. He is quite biased against certain candidates and parties, yet some of the things he says contradict with his own biased statements-- apparently not enough to get him to change his mind.. What a letdown."
9,3.0,3.0, PS506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"LOVED his class. Learned so much! He made it interesting by actually ""talking"" to the class and not lecturing in a monotone class.  He has a sense of humor about things,but if ur not a ""favorite"" don't expect to be called on. My favorite PS class ever."
10,5.0,1.0, PS506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Dr. Asher is a wonderful professor. No political science degree is complete without taking his classes. Lectures were interesting, and I learned a great deal from him."
11,3.5,2.0, PS506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Great lectures, you will learn a good deal about Ohio Politics."
12,4.0,1.0, PS502,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,Good prof... easy class didn't buy the books and go an A.  Just show up and you'll be fine.
13,5.0,2.0, POLI502,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Great class.  If you are actually a PoliSci major this is a great class and you will learn a lot.  This is a high level class so no, he is not going to hold your hand and give you outlines and essay questions but it is stupid to presume that an instructor should do so.  It's called college, not high school. Overall, a good class with lots of info."
14,4.5,2.0, POL502,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Really, great guy, great class.  Those claiming he is biased are absolutely ridiculous, you can be conservative as you want and the guy is respectful.  Easy, fun, and informative.  Take him if you can."
15,4.5,3.0, POLSC506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Herb Asher is the best professor at OSU!  His lectures are interesting, informative, and full of relevant anecdotes.  He loves what he teaches and he cares for his students.  If you get to know him, he will make a great mentor and will take the time to meet with you and offer advice to you.  I always looked forward to going to his classes!"
16,3.0,3.0, POLI502,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"decent professor and a funny guy, although you don't really learn a lot in his class. exams are not fun at all, since he doesn't provide an outline of terms or anything to that extent in the way of preperation. overall it's not that difficult of a class, just be prepared to spend time working outside of class doing volunteering, surveys, etc."
17,3.0,3.0, PS506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Do not even bother unless you are a democrat. Very Very liberal. Biggest name dropper in the world. Who the hell cares who Vern Riffe is, I sure don't. HAVE FUN!!!!"
18,5.0,3.0, POLS506,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Excellent professor!  If you want to learn about Ohio and her politics, there is no better professor to have than Herb Asher; itâ€™s definitely a class that you don't want to miss!  His lectures are always informative, relevant and never boring.  On a separate note, I read one of his books for another class (Polling and the Public:  What Every Citize"
19,5.0,3.0, POLITSC502,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,"Straight forward class: midterm, final, and paper"
20,3.5,3.0, OHIOPOLITICS,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HERB,ASHER,Good lectures.  Go to class in order to do well on the tests.  Grades papers slightly hard.  Knows his Ohio policitcs quite well.
