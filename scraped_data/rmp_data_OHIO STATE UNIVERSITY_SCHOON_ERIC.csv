1,4.0,2.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"Professor Schoon's online class was one of my easier classes. It was asynchronous and consisted of weekly readings (25-30 pgs.), video lectures with slides (about 1 hr.), an application activity (1 paragraph), and short quizzes that are open note. It may sound bad, but there's a one week grace period and multiple (a lot) extra credit opportunities."
2,4.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,Prof Schoon was a great professor. Lectures averaged about 1 hour long. There was a weekly quiz and discussion. There is a one-week grace period. Overall this was a straightforward class. Some of the TA's grade harshly but not professor Schoon.
3,5.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"Took his asynchronous course and it was perfect for my busy schedule. Each weekly module consisted of a 30ish page reading, an hour long pre-recorded lecture, an (easy) quiz, and a 2 paragraph application assignment. Just take notes on the readings and lectures and you will be fine quizzes are open book, too! The man is also very funny."
4,4.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,Overall this class was no too hard. Doing the readings were a must and taking very detailed notes on book and lecture videos. He makes questions a little too specific sometimes but overall and easy class. Schoon was very passionate about this course and gives lots of extra credit.
5,4.0,2.0, SOC1011,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,He is an amazing professor. He gives lots of extra credit. Would recommend.
6,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,I took Intro to Sociology online with Dr. Schoon and his class was very well organized. 1 quiz and 1 small writing assignment were due every Sunday. The TAs are more likely to respond faster than the actual professor.
7,4.0,4.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"This class was a great course for getting feet wet into classes at OSU. In my personal opinion, this asynchronous course allowed plenty of time to finish coursework throughout the entire semester. Professor Schoon was amazing in how much extra credit that you received during the semester. The textbook is an easy read, the assignments are easy."
8,2.0,4.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"There were multiple times I reached out to Prof Schoon and (if) I got a reply, I legit said aloud, ""well thanks for nothing."" I cannot express how impersonal this class was. I understand it was asynchronous but I literally felt like I was 100% teaching myself. It was so hard to keep up with the lengthy readings and long lectures. Do not recommend."
9,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,Pretty chill teacher overall. Watch the lectures and read the textbook and you'll pass just fine.
10,4.0,3.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"Honestly a really nice guy. His class was completely asynchronous and every week there is a quiz and application. I did struggle with some quizzes because of the amount of reading and lecture notes to write down but he offers a lot of extra credit opportunities! Overall, good class just watch and study the content. Also give grace periods!"
11,5.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"One of my best professors so far! The only reason I got a B in this class was because I had a few missing assignments from being lazy on my part. Two assignments per week, the quizzes are super easy and open book. The essays are fairly easy as well as long as you understand information. Dr. Schoon was super understanding with the pandemic!"
12,4.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"Wasnt my favorite class but dr. Schoon was very kind and helpful. I took this class online and there were weekly readings, lecture notes and quizzes. Then there are 2 essays and a final project. Everything was fairly easy and theres a lot of extra credit. If you think you deserved a higher grade on the essay, just ask him to look it over again"
13,4.0,3.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"Classwork is done on your own time. There was one assignment and quiz a week along with 2 papers for the semester. No midterms. There is a final project but no final. TA is very helpful and responds quickly. Lectures are iffy sometimes but usually helpful. Sometimes the quiz questions were a little specific. If you read, quizzes aren't that hard"
14,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"Three open note midterms, two papers and one course project, so not a lot of work outside of class, but you have to do well on all the exams/projects. He is accessible outside of class to go over exam questions that were missed. He also gets rid of questions on the exams if a significant amount of people miss the same question. Great guy!"
15,3.0,3.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"The essays dragged my grade from a A to a B, which was a bit annoying because they were graded by the TAs not him. As a lecturer, I had a hard time keeping focused during class, I feel like he went on a tangents. Otherwise, he's a funny guy. He could stick a mic under your face during class, happened to me once and I just said ""I don't know."""
16,4.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"Super nice guy, very caring of the class and students and it shows. Attendance isn't mandatory and exams are open book and online. Super easy class."
17,4.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"Dr. Schoon is a wonderful and funny professor and I very much enjoyed his class. The exams are open book, open note, and do not have to be taken in the classroom. He has very few grades, but if you put in the effort, you'll get a good grade. He posts all the notes online and reading the book isn't necessary, but helpful. Positive and happy guy."
18,5.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"Dr. Schoon is awesome! You can tell he cares about his students and sociology. His exams are all open note, open textbook, open google... and he ends up taking questions off that were commonly missed. The two 3 page essays given throughout the semester are the only work that you will have to do for this class, but youll still end up learning a lot"
19,3.0,3.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,he is a great professor but the exam is really hard although it is an open book exam. The paper instruction is not clear at all so a lot of people ask questions in-office hours. Prepared to wait for at least 30 min for the office hour.
20,4.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,SCHOON,"Tbh I literally didn't go to class, went the first week then never showed up again. He posts all his slides and the exams are online so basically I just had those up while I took exams, ended the semester with an A- so I wouldn't say you have to go to class. Also never used the textbook so I wouldn't recommend buying it."
