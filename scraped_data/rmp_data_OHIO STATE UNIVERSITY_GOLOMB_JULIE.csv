1,3.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,She's a sweet person but the lectures are a drag. It's entirely possible to pass the class with an A and only show up for the 4 required classes. She is passionate about what she teaches and cares about her students but lectures are not very engaging and are relatively boring. Exams are open note but they're also difficult. 
2,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,"She is AMAZING! She gives interesting lectures(cute memes) and offers study guides before exams. If you do them, you will do well in the exams. Papers are graded clearly and have rubrics(useful) beforehand. Attendance is not required unless there is an activity on that day. The activities are funny and not difficult. Assignments are easy. "
3,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,She was so sweet! She seemed to genuinely care about her students and had interesting activities to do in break-out rooms (which I usually hate). Her tests are moderately difficult but all content is from her lectures which is nice since you don't have to guess what material is from the book/lecture. I definitely recommend !!
4,1.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,"The most boring class of my existence. Make sure you peep her extra credit point, as it would've allowed for me to not take the final haha. Basically you can schedule this class and only show up for exams and be 100% fine. It just is a drag. She will throw shade at you if you are not paying attention in lecture. This includes being on your laptop."
5,3.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,"Lectures were bland, but posted online. Class was relatively easy, as I never read the book and only studied a loose hour before the exams, earning a B overall. Then again, I'd also taken a couple overlapping Psych courses. I think my boredom with the material contributed to my lack of motivation tbh. Average course overall. DOES DROP 1 EXAM GRADE!"
6,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,"Easy tests, engaging lecture (for the material)- there's lots of videos and comics. If you do the study guide for each exam you will be fine. You can also drop one exam making the final optional! Easiest class a neuro major at OSU will ever take."
7,4.0,1.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,"For Cognitive Neuroscience, lectures are very dry and basically consist of her reading off lecture slides (which you can study online) and throwing in barely class-related comics or videos.  Took me about 5 lectures to realize that you're much better off reading lecture slides on your own time.  I got an A by just studying 3 hours total per exam."
8,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,"Julia is awesome. She is funny, and the lecture will fly by if you love neuroscience and the structure of the brain. Her lectures are a lot lecture-based, so take advantage of her online posts and don't skip class!! You will fail and she will not like you."
9,4.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,Exams are fair and pretty easy if you study the slides well and pay attention to videos she shows in class. Your grade is basically based on the best out of three of exams so you have the option to not take the exam. Great class. For neuro majors this is basically a review of everything you've ever learned from other classes. 
10,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,"Awesome professor! Interesting class, AND a very easy A!Despite the easy tests, you learned a lot in this class. Study the study guide and you'll enjoy the class without stressing yourself out. You also get to drop a midterm/the final if you did well enough on the other exams. More teachers should be like this!"
11,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,Dr. Golomb made an extremely uninteresting class exciting and engaging. She is very knowledgable and always willing to help students out. HIGHLY recommend her!
12,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,"She's awesome! She knows what she's talking about, is clear, helpful, and uses a lot of videos and other stuff to help you understand the content. And if you don't, all of it is pretty much in the slides... She always seems to be in a good mood and isn't monotone (thank god). Useless textbook, though... Save your money. You won't need it."
13,4.5,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,"I took Cognitive Neuro with Prof. Golomb. I really enjoyed this class! The material was very engaging when the content could have easily been very dry. I appreciate the fact that she was so open to feedback. I also appreciated the learning aids (videos, demonstrations, etc.) she provided that helped the material sink in."
14,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,Definitely a good professor and loves what she does. Very straightforward with what you need to know which helps a lot to do well overall. I would recommend her!
15,4.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,GOLOMB,"Great professor. Easy to understand, clear powerpoints and lectures. Exams are based entirely on powerpoints, which is great. She also provides study guides which are super helpful. The most interesting and fun neuro class ive attended."
