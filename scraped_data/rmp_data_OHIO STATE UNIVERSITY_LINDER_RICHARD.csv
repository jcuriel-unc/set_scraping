1,3.0,4.0, STAT5302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,LINDER,"Strict, no-nonsense prof. but really helps you understand the math behind the stats. Likes to apply stats to biology examples. Helpful during office hours. Quite proud, though (makes a lot of typos or other mistakes in class but doesn't like to admit them . . .), which I guess was intimidating for some students"
2,4.0,3.0, PUBHBIO2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,LINDER,"He is very caring of his students and wants his students to learn. This is a project class and graded by few things. Little to do outside of class, and class is mandatory unless you don't mind making up in class labs and activities. Good Professor"
