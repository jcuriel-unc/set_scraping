1,5.0,2.0, SOCI006E,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KENNETH,ANDREWS,One of the best professors at UNC. There were some projects throughout the semester but had a lot of time to prepare for them. 
2,5.0,1.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KENNETH,ANDREWS,I had Professor Andrews for Soci-89 (a first year seminar) and really enjoyed the class. The material was very interesting and the way the class was run made me want to participate. The weekly assignments were easy but the readings could get long. There were 3 papers in the class that were manageable. 
3,5.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KENNETH,ANDREWS,"Professor Andrews is hands down the best professor at UNC! I had him for Soci89, a first-year seminar but I recommend him for any class! There were weekly readings that could get pretty lengthy along with 3 essays (the longest was 6 pages). It was very easy to make an A because the readings/discussions were the main chunk of your grade. "
4,5.0,1.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KENNETH,ANDREWS,"Professor Andrews is a GREAT professor. This class was a seminar class, and it was a great learning environment. He is a caring person who cares greatly for his students and their thoughts. The class wasn't hard at all and was actually really engaging. I wouldn't just take this class, but I would take him as a professor for other courses as well!"
5,4.0,1.0, SOCI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KENNETH,ANDREWS,"2 papers + the final was also a paper, but most definitely not a harsh grader. It's pretty writing intensive w/ a 350-word reflection each week but the class is 100% discussion-based & an easy conversation! He just wants to hear your thoughts & if you participate even a little he really appreciates it. Content of the class is very interesting too"
6,4.5,1.0, SOCI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KENNETH,ANDREWS,"Prof. Andrews is one of the kindest professors at UNC. His lectures can be a little boring, but the class is pretty easy and I love him. You do a sort of case study on a social movement of your choosing and write a few papers throughout. They're easy to get an A though. I turned one in 4 hrs late and got a 95%. He's a great mentor, too"
