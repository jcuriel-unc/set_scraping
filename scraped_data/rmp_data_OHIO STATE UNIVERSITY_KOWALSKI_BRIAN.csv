1,4.0,3.0, SOC4611,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRIAN,KOWALSKI,"There are 8 critical thinking assignments (about every other week), 2 exams, and a final paper. I would definitely recommend attending lectures since that is how you get the bulk of information for this class. Dr. Kowalski cares about what he is teaching and makes it interesting. This is a great class and if you put in effort you can do well."
2,2.0,4.0, SOC2310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRIAN,KOWALSKI,I honestly feel the need to help anyone avoid taking this professor by any means. I never felt it was more necessary than ever to warn people to not take any of his classes. Hardest grader for no reason. Not a great fun way to learn.
3,5.0,2.0, SOC2310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRIAN,KOWALSKI,"Dr. Kowalski is one of the best lecturers I've had at OSU. It's obvious he knows a lot about sociology and criminology, but he isn't arrogant about it. He genuinely is interested in teaching his students, and he also gives pointers for tests. As long as you show up to class and do the readings, which are interesting, you shouldn't have a problem."
4,5.0,1.0, SOC2310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRIAN,KOWALSKI,He is the easiest teacher I've ever had and it's not even close. The hardest thing you'll have to do is take notes. Everything you go over in lectures is on the test. I did not study for two test and got out of the class with a B-. Make sure you are there for participation points(random when he gives them).  You learn and can get an easy A.
