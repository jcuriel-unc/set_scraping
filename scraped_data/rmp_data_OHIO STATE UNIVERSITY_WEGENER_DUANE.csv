1,3.0,4.0, PSYCH4630,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DUANE,WEGENER,Dr. Wegener is a very competent researcher - but not a phenomenal lecturer. His tests can be really tough and the material isn't always explained effectively. He implements a curved grading scale on assignments because most people don't do very well. Not that recommended unless you really want to learn about Attitudes and Persuasion.
2,4.0,3.0, 4630,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DUANE,WEGENER,Professor Wegener made the material as interesting as he could!! Tests can be tough! So read and re-read the books and his vague lecture outlines! He gets very specific about theories and major experiments discussed in class!
3,4.5,3.0, PSYCH4630,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DUANE,WEGENER,"Dr. Wegener is fantastic, but a little boring to listen to at 8 a.m. He is an expert in the field of attitudes and persuasion, and it's easy to learn from him."
4,2.5,4.0, PSYC6810,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DUANE,WEGENER,"If you have taken some stats before, maybe you'll be fine. If this is your first taste of stats, good luck. He said that he would stay away from math and deal with ""concepts"".  That seems to have amounted to: you don't have to memorize formulas.  But we NEVER get anything explained using concrete ex's. it's always abstract."
5,3.5,4.0, PSY646,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DUANE,WEGENER,"wasnt bad definitely better than what youd get if you took STAT 514 instead His first exam took about 1 hour 30 minutes longer for us to finish than he had planned. He acted shocked that we werent done, and kinda insulted us saying his undergrads get the same LENGTH of test, which means nothing."
6,4.5,3.0, PSY201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DUANE,WEGENER,"This class is basically stat for psych majors, and I'm so glad I took it!  I hate stat, but Dr. Wegener made it so easy to understand and he cut out a bunch of the stuff we were ""supposed"" to go over, because he said we'd never need it."
7,5.0,3.0, SOCIALPSYCH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DUANE,WEGENER,dr. wegener was teriffic.  he has an amazing amount of knowledge and experience in this subject.  he communicate very well and teaches in an exciting manner.  he makes sure that everyone can understand and master the materail.  i would recommend taking a c
8,4.0,1.0, PSY240,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DUANE,WEGENER,Yeah he was very cool.  He was always pleasant to deal with and seemed genuinely interested in student's concerns.
