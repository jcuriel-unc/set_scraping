1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BALDWIN,WAY,"I really liked him and this class! Content was interesting and relevant. A decent amount of test prep is required due to the number of studies presented, but go through those and youre golden. Lots of grades with exams, online quizzes, top hat, paper, and extra credit. He listens to student feedback and tries to make lecture interesting."
2,5.0,4.0, PSYCH4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BALDWIN,WAY,"I absolutely love Baldwin Way. I took his course in the midst of COVID and he was really understanding with everything going on. If you have the option, 10/10 recommend him. Make sure you read and study, and you'll pass."
3,4.0,3.0, PSYCH4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BALDWIN,WAY,"Prof Way is always willing to answer questions, and it's clear to see that he has a big heart & really cares about his students. The class format is lecture heavy, but it's an upper level course so it's expected to be hard. But of all the upper level courses I have taken, this has been the easiest! 10/10 would recommend!"
4,1.0,4.0, PSYCH4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BALDWIN,WAY,Lectures are super heavy like 50-90 slides but he never finishes most of them. Quizzes and readings are easy but the exams are very difficult. My exam grades did not reflect the rest of my grades. He seems really caring but he makes way too many mistakes on his own exams. I would not recommend. This class was the definition of stress.
5,4.0,4.0, PSYCH4351,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BALDWIN,WAY,"lecture heavy. take good notes. exams are tough but it is a 4000 level course- it is expected. He's nice, and very caring. Even though his lectures are heavy he doesn't make it boring- seems to really care for his students"
6,4.0,3.0, PSY4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BALDWIN,WAY,Professor Way always tried to keep class interesting. His exams were a little tough and he lectures a lot but always tries to keep things upbeat. You can tell he cares about students doing well and is always open to answering questions. He also is open to giving him feedback on the class which is rare but good! I would take his class again!
