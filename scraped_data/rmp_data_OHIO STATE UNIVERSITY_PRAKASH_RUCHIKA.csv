1,4.0,3.0, PSYCH4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RUCHIKA,PRAKASH,She kept the class interested through her stories and videos. Everything on the exams were clear. There were three pop quizzes that were usually announced beforehand. The special topics assignments were graded the hardest. Exams are multiple choice and the final is not cummulative.
2,4.0,3.0, PSYCH4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RUCHIKA,PRAKASH,"she was able to keep the students interested with her stories, showing videos and through group participation. if you go to class, read the textbook and follow along study guides you will do fine! The study guide are helpful and if you attend class she will let you know specifically what you should focus on for exams."
3,1.5,4.0, PSYCH531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RUCHIKA,PRAKASH,"I wouldn't recommend her simply because she didn't structure her 3 exams off of anything in particular and especially not off her lectures. She put extremely random, specific questions on her exams and made more than one multiple choice answer seem correct just to argue with students about it later. The class was boring and not worth the headache."
