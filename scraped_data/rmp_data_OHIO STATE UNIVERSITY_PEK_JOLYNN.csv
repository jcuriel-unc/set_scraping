1,2.0,3.0, PSYCH2220H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOLYNN,PEK,"Dr. Pek was really nice and I could tell she wanted to make the class easier for us, but the class was often disorganized. Notes aren't posted before class and are instead ""group notes"" on a google doc. Lots of group and individual work that didn't translate to exams. I did better in the class when I got 1-on-1 help. Exams identical to practice."
2,2.0,4.0, 2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOLYNN,PEK,"This was her first undergrad class. I had trouble understanding what was going on the majority of the time, and I have taken a stats class before. She offers 5% extra credit to your grade at the end of the semester, but doesn't teach coding in class, and teaches theory instead of the math. I could tell she was trying her best to improve the class."
3,1.0,4.0, PSYC2220H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOLYNN,PEK,"She has never taught an undergraduate class, and it shows. The tests are impossibly hard, and she doesn't teach almost anything close to what is on them. We have help sheets and they still don't do much. The homework is impossible and you have to teach yourself the coding and the methods because she doesn't give practice or example problems."
4,1.0,5.0, 2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOLYNN,PEK,"If you ever are presented with the opportunity to take a class with her, don't. She is the worst professor I have had at this school, probably due to the fact that she has never taught an undergraduate class. Her second exam was impossibly hard and you have to teach yourself how to do the four homework assignments."
