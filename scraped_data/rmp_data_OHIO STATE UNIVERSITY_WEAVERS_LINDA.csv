1,1.0,5.0, EnvEng4090,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LINDA,WEAVERS,"Took her capstone class on main campus. Terrible professor. Randomly assigns grades based on favoritism with no comments on what she is taking points off for. Gave nobody an A in the class even though we spend 40+ hours a week on her class, and we are all SENIORS who need that A. Gives no helpful criticisms and feels like she wants us all to fail. "
