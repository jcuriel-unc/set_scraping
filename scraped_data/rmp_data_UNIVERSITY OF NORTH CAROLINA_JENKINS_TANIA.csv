1,3.0,2.0, SOCI131,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TANIA,JENKINS,Participation once a week. tough grader for a 100 lvl course. Exams are a mix of multiple choice and short response. Readings for class are sometimes long. This class will likely take more time out of your day than any 200 lvl course. 
2,4.0,2.0, SOCI131,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TANIA,JENKINS,"Dr. Jenkins made a T/Th class interesting! Class is very reading and participation heavy, but if you go to lecture and pay attention she makes it very easy to succeed. Did not like the class at first as I thought the workload may have been too heavy for a 100 level, but it really is all for your benefit. "
3,3.0,4.0, SOCI131,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TANIA,JENKINS,Professor Jenkins cares for her students but for a 100 level class grades to harshly. Attendance is not mandatory but you have to participate weekly. There is pop quizzes and the readings can be difficult. There is multi part definitions for simple words which make the class harder than it should. Must attend all classes to do well in the class. 
4,4.0,3.0, SOCI131,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TANIA,JENKINS,"This class isn't necessarily easy, but you should do fine if you put in effort and study before tests. 2midterms=30% , final=25%. participation/in-class assignments=10%, paper=25%. If you don't want to try that much for a 100 lvl course don't take this, but if you are okay studying a bit then do. it is manageable. Most honest answer on here so far."
5,5.0,3.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TANIA,JENKINS,"I took 2 courses with Dr. Jenkins, & she was honestly the professor who made the biggest difference in my life at UNC. If you are a first gen or at all interested in medical or sociology she's a must. Her grading is fair, and criteria is direct, she's personable in office hours. Essay based exams: give verbatim definitions and know CONTEXT!!! 10/10"
6,5.0,2.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TANIA,JENKINS,"This is a class that requires a lot of reading, class participation once a week, and class attendance (as she does not post the lecture slides). While the reading may make the class feel tough, the material and lectures are engaging and easily digestible. The tests are easy if you attend class because she reviews at the beginning of each lecture."
7,4.0,2.0, SOCI131,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TANIA,JENKINS,"Easy A if you read assignments and go to class. Have to participate once a week otherwise its in-class assignments, 2 midterms, 5 pg OP-Ed, and final. Very flexible and responsive to student questions. Highly recommend as she really makes subject matter interesting and understandable"
8,4.0,4.0, SOCI131,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TANIA,JENKINS,"At first, I wasnt a huge fan but shes definitely one of my favorite professors. She truly cares about her students! great in-depth lectures, she explains things very well. quite a few in class assignments. make sure to participate once a week because she is big on that. 2 midterms, 1 5 page paper and the final. The material was very interesting !"
9,3.0,3.0, SOCI131,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TANIA,JENKINS,Professor Jenkins is a nice person. Her class is extremely structured and she obviously cares about the material. Once a week participation is mandatory and in-class assignments occur on a weekly basis.
