1,4.0,1.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PATRICK,CARROLL,Had him for psych 1100; a great choice for my first college class. Thought it was pretty easy. He curved most our tests 6-10 points. Was very happy with the overall experience.
2,1.0,5.0, PSYCH4500,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PATRICK,CARROLL,Was late to the majority of classes and was not prepared most of the time. Was aggressive to students in lecture and email who had issues understanding concepts. His clothes were sometimes dirty and his butt hung out. He also had poor hygiene. He took a long time to grade and return emails. I learned nothing from the class
3,3.5,3.0, 1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PATRICK,CARROLL,"I really liked the class. I see some complains about his being late, but I was actually appreciated his being late for the class so I don't have to get there at time lol Also, you really don't need a book the powerpoint handout is the only thing you need. "
4,5.0,3.0, PSYPSY,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PATRICK,CARROLL,Fantastic Professor.
5,5.0,5.0, PSY364,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PATRICK,CARROLL,"This guy is fantastic.  He is very helpful, and I would take anything he teaches."
6,1.5,3.0, PSYCH367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PATRICK,CARROLL,"Terrible professor. Doesn't make any attempt to understand students, only throws definitions at problems. Late to every class. Grades papers using keywords, not concepts. Makes copies of the SEI's..."
7,1.5,3.0, PYSCH367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PATRICK,CARROLL,"I didn't like this class, or him as a teacher.  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.  Walks in late every day, wears wife beaters and jeans (eew!), takes weeks to hand back papers and exams, lectures straight from powerpoint, takes forever to answer emails... His comments on papers and exams are completely illegible, and thus useless. Take another writing class!"
8,3.5,2.0, 367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PATRICK,CARROLL,"Can't really depend on his notes, if you read you will be fine though!! This class has a heavy workload! Pat konws what he is talking about but don't depend on him for help, he is really busy and probably will not answer your e-mails!"
9,2.0,4.0, PSYCH36701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PATRICK,CARROLL,I was definitely not a fan. A majority of my E-mails went unanswered and he took forever to grade exams and papers. Not helpful at all.
