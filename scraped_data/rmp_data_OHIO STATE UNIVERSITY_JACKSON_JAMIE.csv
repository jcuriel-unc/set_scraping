1,4.5,2.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMIE,JACKSON,She made the boring parts interesting and explained everything clearly. I very  much enjoyed this class and changed my major to psych. In-class mini-experiments were awesome and helped me remember the content. I never purchased the book and got an A. Highly recommend this prof!
2,5.0,2.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMIE,JACKSON,Jamie is awesome. Lecture isn't necessary and she even says that from the beginning. All you need to do is read the textbook and show up for quizzes and you're golden.
3,5.0,1.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMIE,JACKSON,She was by far the best prof. for this course.  She took normally boring material and made it interesting.  Her quizzes are challenging but NOBODY should have problems if they read the book.
4,4.5,4.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMIE,JACKSON,ok
5,5.0,1.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMIE,JACKSON,She was AMAZING!
6,4.5,2.0, PSYC100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMIE,JACKSON,"Jamie was an excellent teacher. She has an awesome personality that made the class material, otherwise pretty intersting. The tests were sometimes difficult but there is no reason you can't pass if you read some of the book and go to the review sessions. The book is a must have for a good grade :( I definitely recommend    Jamie."
