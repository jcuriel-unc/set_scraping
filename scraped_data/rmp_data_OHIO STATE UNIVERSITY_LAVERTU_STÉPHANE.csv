1,5.0,3.0, PA4011,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,I would highly recommend Stephane whether you're taking a higher or lower level class. He really makes the lectures interesting and engaging. You can tell hes very genuine and makes it very easy to participate. Definitely best quality is that he's understanding and approachable. Seriously can't stress that enough he wants to help.
2,2.0,4.0, PUBAFRS2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,"I did not enjoy having Stephane as a professor. He grades way too harshly for such a low level course and does not have clear grading criteria. The course was online but we had to schedule a time to take exams in person at the testing center, which is tough for people with tight schedules."
3,2.0,4.0, PUBAFFRS2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,IMO the online lectures are very hard to follow because he rambles a lot. Not very interesting either and very time consuming course.
4,4.0,4.0, PUBAF2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,He turned a topic I didnt care the slightest about into something accessible and actually pretty interesting. You can tell he cares about making sure his students do well.
5,4.0,3.0, PUBAFFRS2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,"He is obviously very knowledgeable in his field and attempts to convey this knowledge onto his students. However, his grading criteria, especially for the papers, is not very clear. It is best to set up meetings with him or to go to office hours to really understand what he is looking for. He gives a test bank for exams."
6,3.0,4.0, PUBAF2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,Mr. Lavertu is a great teacher don't get me wrong but he is extremely difficult at grading and he doesn't cut you a break. The final exam questions are very tough to understand. He is a great teacher but I don't recommend him due to his extremely difficult grading style. Take someone else who is easier if you can.
7,4.5,2.0, PUBAFFRS2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,I really loved Stephane! Such a great guy and presents dull information in an interesting way. 2110 is really easy and he makes an effort to know all of his students.
8,4.5,2.0, PA2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,"Great professor - really passionate about making sure students know the information in addition to passing the class. He's understanding and reasonable about grading. If you show up on the review day, he'll pretty much tell you exactly what he wants you to say on the exam. "
9,5.0,2.0, PUBAFRS2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,"He is one of the most interesting professors I've ever had. He has made boring policy lessons, lectures that were some of my favorites for the year. Overall he is an outstanding professor and incredibly knowledgable on his subject."
10,5.0,3.0, PUBAFFRS2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,"Easily the best class and professor I've had so far. He is very engaging, extremely knowledgeable, and fair. I learned a lot and never had to stress out over anything in the class. "
11,5.0,3.0, 2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,Stephane is the best! He is knowledgeable and very helpful. As long as you participate and study you will pass. He's not super easy but he's also not hard as long as you do the basic studying (nothing crazy)!
12,1.5,4.0, PUBAFFRS2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,Tough grader wants more than what is needed. Tried really hard to only receive a B+ 
13,5.0,3.0, PUBAFRS2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,"Stephane is easily the best professor I've ever had. He's fair, absolutely hilarious, and is always willing to help you out. Great person overall and great professor! His class is definitely difficult if you skip it because all material is covered in the lecture, and his lectures really aren't bad to sit through at all."
14,5.0,2.0, PA2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,I loved this class! He is that rare type of professor that gets you excited about the material. It's clear he loves his subject and he's awesome about answering questions and interacting with the students. Take good notes and you'll do fine.
15,4.0,1.0, PA2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,"Prof. Lavertu makes the class interesting. Make sure to take down all notes he writes on the board because that is basically his exam. Beware though that he's a tough grader. As long as you put thought into your work you should be fine. If you're ever stuck, go to office hours. He loves to help his students."
16,5.0,2.0, PUBAF2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,"I absolutely loved this class. Stephane was extremely engaging and found the perfect mixture of between having fun in class and learning the material. He sometimes rambles, but it's an endearing sort of teaching that normally leads to some laughs."
17,5.0,2.0, PUBAF2110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STÉPHANE,LAVERTU,He was great! Loved the class. He is very energetic and makes the topics interesting. Take his class!!
