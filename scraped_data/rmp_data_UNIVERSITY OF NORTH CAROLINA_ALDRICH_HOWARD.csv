1,5.0,3.0, SOCI57H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"He is very caring and enjoys what he teaches. The course is dependent on a final 20-page term paper, with around 2 short assignments a week, and no exams/quizzes! Excellent choice for an Honors Seminar. Make sure to plan out getting the paper done, and you will be fine!"
2,5.0,2.0, SOCI57H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,Professor Aldrich is so wonderful! Thoroughly enjoyed this class and the class environment was very safe and inclusive. Class revolves around one large term paper which is manageable given that we spend all semester researching for it. No quizzes or exams. Professor Aldrich gives thoughtful feedback on assignments. Great option for honors seminar.
3,5.0,1.0, SOCI57H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"Workload involves basic knowledge checks before class and the large cumulative term paper. The course reflects what you put in. If you are passionate and engage with Aldrich's material, you will breeze through. If not, you will find the class moderately difficult and boring. It's a very unique holistic approach to teaching at UNC, would recommend!"
4,5.0,3.0, SOCI57H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,the only bad part about this class is that you have to write a 15 page term paper but he breaks it up into smaller assignments as the semester goes on so it is manageable. the material is so interesting and he is great. really cares about his students success. he has past students who have done well come in and help you too. take him if you can!
5,5.0,4.0, SOCI057H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"Professor Aldrich is really caring when it comes to his students. If you're ever struggling, I recommend coming to officer hours or sending him an email. His grading is relatively fair as long as you show you understand Ritzer's four components of Rationalization (control, predictability, efficiency, & calculability). "
6,4.0,2.0, SOCI57H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"Aldrich really cares about his students. Though his grading criteria is sometimes confusing (he is not always specific about what he wants, and online assignment descriptions don't usually match what he asks for in class), if you go to his office hours, he always helps you out. Kind of a lot of work for a first-year seminar, but doable for sure."
7,4.0,2.0, SOCI57H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"Professor Aldrich cares a lot about this class and his students. He gives good and very quick feedback. The subject matter is interesting but gets repetitive. Two short (two-page) papers, one medium (four-page) paper, and one long (fifteen-page) term paper. Lenient grader and offers support and good feedback. You don't ever want to disappoint him!"
8,4.0,3.0, SOCI57H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,Interesting course taught by a nice man who knows his stuff. Class is graded fairly leniently as it is a first-year seminar. He assigned a couple of fun projects throughout the semester.
9,5.0,3.0, SOCI57H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,Great professor! Really interested in the topic and wanted his students to learn. Course was composed of four short papers and a 15 page paper that you worked on throughout the semester. Very manageable as he provides great resources. Lots of group work and a final fun group project
10,4.0,3.0, SOCI57H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"No tests, only papers. He does not grade hard."
11,5.0,3.0, SOCI057H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,super nice guy who really cares about his students
12,5.0,2.0, SOCI57H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"Aldrich cares SO much about SOCI & students. Majority of grades are 4 short papers and one 15 page term paper, which is daunting but if you start early (or if you don't, it's manageable) He really wants to see students succeed. Utilize office hours even just to get to know him. Class itself is easy: groupwork, discussion, & activities/guests."
13,2.0,5.0, 89H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"This seminar is not for those looking for an easy A. There is so much writing in this class. There were four ""short"" papers and a massive 15 page paper at the end of the semester. He grades the short papers HARSHLY. Best comment on my paper, ""You seem to write things without thinking them through or caring."" Use his office hours for a better grade"
14,5.0,3.0, SOCI89H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,Professor Aldrich truly cares about his students! He is extremely accessible outside of class and welcomes student feedback.
15,3.0,3.0, SOCI89H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"His first year seminar is graded on mostly papers, specifically a 15 page term paper, so be ready to write. Aldrich is a very interactive professor and cares about his students, but don't take this seminar if you're looking for an easy fys."
16,3.0,3.0, SOCI89H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"Professor Aldrich was awesome in terms of caring about his field of work, but this SOCI89H class became very redundant, very quickly. For people who are actually interested in full-scale rationalization of America, this class is for you! For me, I only enjoyed having Aldrich as a professor because he was helpful and intuitive, not due to the course"
17,4.0,3.0, SOCI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"Professor Aldrich may come off as dry, but as the semester progresses it becomes apparent just how much he cares about the subject matter he is teaching. The final grade is comprised of  a few 2-page essays, participation, and discussion. Fairly easy class if you put forth the effort, and can be very interesting at times."
18,4.0,2.0, SOCI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"Prof. Aldrich was great in my first-year seminar. He assigns a lot of short papers (2 - 5 pages, depending on the assignment) and grades pretty harshly, but if you use the sources he gives you, you should get a good grade. He cares about his students and gives monthly energy checks to make sure we're taking care of our mental health."
19,5.0,2.0, SOCI006E,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"He taught a great first year seminar on the ""McDonaldization of Society"".  He's passionate about teaching, sociology, and helping students understand the material."
20,3.5,1.0, SOCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,HOWARD,ALDRICH,"ok. not a hard grader and a decent teacher, but kind of a flake. relies heavily on jargon, ideology and intellectual trends."
