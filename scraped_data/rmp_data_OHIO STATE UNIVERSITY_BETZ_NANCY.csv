1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,"I LOVED this professor.  She extremely helpful with any questions you may have, and she really cares for her students.  She is AWESOME!"
2,4.5,2.0, PSYCH511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,"Dr. Betz is absolutely amazing. She is friendly and funny and I actually enjoyed lectures. Material isn't hard to deal with and there's no textbook, 3 exams worth 60pts each and a couple small assignments. I had her for Psych 300 as well, I'd recommend her for any class. She's caring, considerate, and understanding. I can't say enough. She's great"
3,5.0,1.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,"Dr. Betz is the one of the nicest professors I've ever had.  I would take her again if i could...her TA Hye Bin is a tough grader though.  300 is an easy class, an easy A."

5,5.0,2.0, PSYCH511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,"Good teacher, great person. Willing to go above and beyond to help students. Left me a note on my homework asking if I wanted any advice on applying to graduate schools, without me asking her beforehand."
6,4.0,4.0, PSYCH511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,"Dr. Betz is SUCH a nice lady!! This class is tough though, and there is no book, so you pretty much just have your lecture slides and notes to go by. I would recommend attending lecture even though the subject matter can be very dry. Study hard and you'll do fine. I really recommend this class to psych students who want to go to grad school!"
7,4.0,2.0, PSY220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,Dr. Betz is ALWAYS there to help and will work with you if you ask her to.  She does make semi-frequent mistakes on her powerpoint slides etc. but if you are confused she will clear the confusion for you.  Class is hard but if you need help ASK and you will be fine.
8,1.5,5.0, PSYCH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,Has no clue what she's doing. She spends more time correcting her mistakes and rushing through material than actually explaining the material. A straight Stats class would be more helpful.
9,4.5,2.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,"If you go to class and pay attention, I don't see how you could not do well. Though i did not personally find the subject matter to be interesting, class was bearable and attendance (while not mandatory) will really help you, because a lot of what is said in class is helpful in understanding and learning the material, and is included on the exams."
10,5.0,2.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,"Class dragged on a little but Nancy made it fun. Grade is determined from 3 hw short hw assignments, a survey, 2 midterms, and a comprehensive final. I didn't look at the book once and I got a B+ in the class. Print out the notes, go to lecture, and you will have no problem. Also, her TA is a very sweet girl who is very helpful."
11,1.0,3.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,Terrible. Her lectures and notes drag on forever. The TA was awful as his e-mails and exams were riddled with poor grammar and contradictions. This class was a complete waste of time.
12,5.0,2.0, PSYCH511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,Dr. Betz is cool! I picked up this class last minute after dropping something else and I'm really glad I did because it was not only surprisingly interesting but personally enriching (you get to take career and personality tests). She's really clear and helpful too and has an amusing dry humor. I would take anything else she teaches.
13,5.0,2.0, PSYCH511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,Dr. Betz is awesome. She's funny and adorably awkward if I weren't graduating I'd try to take more classes from her. Doesn't make you buy a book either!
14,5.0,2.0, PSYCH511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,Very sweet woman. Extremely helpful. Decently interesting class.
15,5.0,1.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,Amazing teacher!  Keeps lectures interesting and is so extremely helpful in making sure you understand everything!!!
16,4.5,1.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,"take your next class with prof betz!! she's awesome...always ends class 15 mins early, puts all notes up on power point.  only 3 homework assignments and 3 exams.  the homework was quite easy, and the exams are all 50 mc questions.  her wording can be a bit misleading, but if you get less than a B you're an idiot"
17,4.5,1.0, PSYCH597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,"Extremely lenient on tests, never gave out homework assignments, and very intellectual on the material.  The classes were somewhat boring, but if you made an effort, she'd make sure you got a good grade no matter what."
18,5.0,3.0, PSYCH511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,"Dr. Betz is awesome! I only took this class because I knew it was good for grad school prep, but now I love psych testing! I would recomend this class or any of her classes to anyone. She's a great professor and really funny. I always looked forward to her lectures!"
19,5.0,5.0, PSY530,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,I loved this class!
20,5.0,2.0, PSYCHOLOGY887,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NANCY,BETZ,"Great job! Learned a lot in this course. The atmosphere was supportive, and discussion topics and presenters were excellent!"
