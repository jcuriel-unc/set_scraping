1,5.0,3.0, PSYC533,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,BAUER,"He is very knowledgeable in quantitative psych and easy to talk to. It's not an easy A class, but he makes a dreary stats class enjoyable. Truly a gem in the department."
2,4.0,4.0, PSYC533H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,BAUER,"Bauer ranks 1-2 standard deviations above the average instructor in kindness and understanding. Very easy to talk to. Virtual lectures sometimes were slow. Grades of 95 and above were A's. Generous but not very clear grading criteria. No final, just assignments, group project, and quizzes with like 5 questions (eek!)"
