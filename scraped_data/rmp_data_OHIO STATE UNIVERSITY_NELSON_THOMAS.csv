1,3.0,4.0, POLITSC3170,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"This was probably one of the hardest political science classes I've taken. The readings were really interesting which I appreciated. Overall though, Professor Nelson was fine but his tests were very difficult and he graded the papers harshly as well. He did curve our grades a little though."
2,1.0,5.0, POLISCI3170,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"Class isnt really interesting and is just way harder than it needs to be, second lowest gpa on the department and spends the whole lecture on one topic going in more depth than he needs to be, attendance is t mandatory but if you dont go there are 0 resources to have a majority of the material explained to you"
3,2.0,4.0, POLITSC3170,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,Professor Nelson seems like an extremely nice guy. I just think the way he teaches isnt effective at all. His lectures seem very simple it feels like you understand the subject but the readings are much tougher. I think he should incorporate more of the reading into lecture. On exams he words things in a confusing way with multiple right answers
4,1.0,4.0, POLISC37,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"I would not recommend taking any course with Thomas. The lecture material is hard to shift through and the lack of explanation makes it impossible to study for test. Youre essentially graded on 4 different things through the course. Ohio State has some amazing lectures and political science classes that will help you grow, this isnt one."
5,1.0,4.0, POLISCI3170,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE TO. The lectures are so boring, it's hard to attend. The exams are extremely hard. Weekly quizzes that are 3 questions each. 1 final paper. The topic for the paper is extremely vague. The exams are challenging and mostly based off of lecture."
6,1.0,4.0, POLISCI3170,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"I would NOT recommend taking this class. 3 exams and a paper make up 95% of the grade. Test questions are confusing and the paper instruction is very vague. The worst grade I've ever received, retaking just to save my GPA. Professor seems nice but the class is terrible. Save yourself"
7,5.0,1.0, POLISCI3170,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"Fairly standard lecture-heavy course. Extremely manageable: three exams, all easy if you pay attention in class and go over the study guides that have exactly what you need to know on them. One short paper that's opinion based. A bit dry sometimes but honestly I wish I could have him for every class, he's a very manageable, respectable teacher."
8,3.0,4.0, PS4160,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"The class lectures leaned toward monotone and dry. It was unfortunate, because I think that Prof. Nelson is really passionate about the subject. He seems like a brilliant social scientist, but his lectures were unfortunately not very engaging. It was also made more difficult by the fact that the exam content and paper criteria were not very clear."
9,1.0,5.0, POLISC3170,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"My first ever B earned in this class. He never responds to emails. He is extremely boring, didn't learn a thing in this class. Would not recommend taking any classes and especially not political psychology. The exams were really hard. Only 36 multiple choice questions that are extremely confusing. Weekly reading quizzes that can tank your grade."
10,4.0,1.0, PS3905,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"I really liked this class. It was low-effort but topical/useful/informative. There are textbook quizzes on Carmen, but they aren't worth much and the exams were based entirely on lecture. Lecture kind of drones on, but he posts the slides online and the exams were cake."
11,3.0,3.0, PS4160,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"If you're interested in his subject area, his class isn't too bad. But he's a fairly dry lecturer, and is a bit monotonous."
12,4.0,3.0, PS3905,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,Great professor - a bit dry and hard to pay attention to. Very personable and willing to help if students need help. Excellent professor.
13,3.5,1.0, POLITSC3549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"Pretty much the same as what other folks have said, he's not super inspiring, but his class is pretty easy and one of the best ways to get rid of the elective for the BS in PoliSci"
14,2.5,3.0, POLITSC3905,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"To be frank, very boring course/professor. Lectures are dry/confusing and the whole course just falls flat consistently. The tests pretty much boil down to terminology which I find rather uninspiring but reasonably easy to study, so there's that at least. End of the day I feel I've barely learned anything from it and  that's a real shame. "
15,3.5,3.0, PS4160,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"Class is so so boring. Taught myself a lot of the time because it was so hard to go. The tests are a little tricky, but if you go to class and pay attention you can probably get an A."
16,3.0,2.0, PS4160,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"He can be a bit dry, ok really dry. However he grades on a curve set from the bottom instead of the top which is nice. We hardly use the textbook and he uses a lot of examples. Take his pretests, most of the questions are on the exam."
17,1.5,2.0, PSPS,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"We spent a day talking about Plagarism, but this was a 503 class-we ought to know all about that by now. He wastes time, & uses way too many examples! I really really dislike him for so many reasons, ranging from unclear directions, to changing class rooms in the middle of the quarter without telling you! He teaches and pushes intelligent design."
18,2.0,3.0, PLSCI503,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"a nice guy but class is tremendously boring. Most of material is not relevant to daily life and generally not organized well. One extra credit assignment was offered and as stated before, not much room for error in assignments. In general, would not reccomend unless extremely and utterly interested in political psychology."
19,1.5,3.0, POLIT367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,extremely nice guy but class is very dry and boaring. He tends to go off on tangents leaving the class fairly confused and does not intail what he wants or expects on assignments. If you have no knowledge or intrest in Psychology avoid this class at all costs.
20,5.0,1.0, POLISCI36701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NELSON,"Mandatory attendence... need I say more? The lectures were dull but the discussions were interesting. The text was poorly written and boring to read, but had a lot of interesting information. The novels were unnecessary but the paper topics were easy and he grades very easily on the papers. He also offers extra credit. Satisfactory professor."
