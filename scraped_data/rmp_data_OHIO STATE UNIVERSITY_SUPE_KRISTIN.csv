1,3.0,3.0, PSYCH4501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"Pros:Is an engaging lecturer and assignments are reasonable. 
Cons:Believes she is more accommodating than she is. Students are able to turn in homework or quizzes three days late twice, not the worst extension policy, but she frames it as being so understanding even though three days is not a lot of time when you're really going through it.

2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"I would recommend taking Dr. Supe for an upper level neuro class! She is really fun and assignments are pretty easy. Three group projects throughout the semester, but all very manageable. She's very accessible outside of class and fair grader with clear expectations. "
3,5.0,4.0, PSY3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"She is so awesome she made me switch to neuro, she is hilarious so passionate about her subject and a super engaging and sympthetic professor. I would normally hate a professor if I didn't get an A but I just cant hate her she is an awesome lecturer and makes the material funny and engaging. I'd recommend her to anyone!"
4,5.0,2.0, PSY3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"Extremely well set up online course. Sends out weekly reminders and wants students to do well. Wants to get to know you when you drop by office hours. If you watch all the lectures, it is pretty easy to get an A. Be prepared to spend about 10-20 hours watching lectures per week, though."
5,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"Great prof, she's an excellent teacher. Great at breaking down complex topics and approaching potentially sensitive topics thoughtfully and respectfully. This class was group-project heavy, but it's full of overachieving neuro majors, so you should be fine. There is an emphasis on the real-world application of knowledge and science communication."
6,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,I would recommend taking this class because its really hard. The teacher is nice but you will most likely struggle.  
7,5.0,5.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"Amazingly knowledgeable and informative. Notoriously difficult core class, wasnt so hard online and asynchronous but not sure if it asynchronous still"
8,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4501,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"I had Dr. Supe for both PSYCH3313 and again for PSYCH4501, and she is just as wonderful. This class is themed around sleep and the brain, and there are no exams -- just three group projects and weekly Carmen quizzes. She cares a lot about the wellbeing of her students and is one of the most understanding professors I've had at OSU."
9,4.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"Dr. Supe is a very kind lecturer, and I enjoyed Behavioral Neuro! The notes are extremely long, however, and tests are difficult with little time to complete. If you are struggling, Dr. Supe is a great person to access and is understanding. The coursework is very time consuming, but if youre interested in the topics then its really not horrible."
10,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"Phenomenal professor. She really understands her students. Class was very organized and consisted of two assignments, a quiz and a video essay each week. The quizzes come straight from the PPT, the video essays are very simple and are only like a minute long. The assignments can be reading research papers to doing infographics. Cool class too!"
11,4.0,4.0, PSY3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"Her class was the most challenging one I've taken as a psych major, but it got better later in the semester. Most of the content was learned from the lectures, which could get lengthy. Textbook was optional. Homework/discussions were pretty easy. Biweekly quizzes were worth many points and could be stressful because of time constraints."
12,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"The lectures were A LOT, especially for online class, but if you kept up and took good notes her exams were a breeze. Open note, open book (although I don't use the book) and no surprises at all."
13,3.0,4.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"Class was completely online and done on your own time. There is a quiz every other week that's worth a decent amount, however, there is a decent amount of extra credit that really helps your grade if you do it. If you have questions office hours can be very helpful. They told many stories told and videos can get tedious but overall decent class"
14,3.0,4.0, PSY3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"Took this class during the times of Covid so it was all online with pre recorded lectures. I found it very difficult to pay attention during these lectures especially when each module had at least 10 lecture videos. Professor Supe seems like a great professor, but I wish she would have cut students a little slack during these hard times."
15,4.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"COVID-19: Class was asynchronous, gave lots of opportunities for points via quizzes, assignments, discussion boards. Great lecturer, enthusiastic delivery of material. Assignments could be busy work and somewhat insulting to collegiate level students (scavenger hunt activities?), but fine for the points. Be prepared to keep up with lectures."
16,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"So funny and lively! A bright and warm person who keeps students engaged and feeling cared about. Always looked forward to the energy and chuckles. Her exam questions are typically ""what does this do, what is its structure, what is its function"" or ""what would happen if this structure/system was impaired"". Know all that and you'll ace :)"
17,4.0,3.0, PSU3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"Professor Supe was an awesome professor. I had her in Summer 2020, so things were a bit odd with the new online schooling but she made everything you need easily accessible. It's important to take notes during lectures and can take a bit of time if you take a lot of notes. The lectures and notes you take are important to study for exams."
18,5.0,3.0, PSY3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"I have to say, I was nervous to take this course online and dreaded it being one of the harder core topics in Psychology. However, Dr. Supe makes it really informational and fun to learn. You can tell she loves teaching the topic and has a big interest in aspects of the brain. Would recommend 100 percent. Pay attention to lectures and do the work!"
19,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"i LOVE dr. supe!!! shes so energetic & truly makes difficult topics easy to remember through tips, tricks, acronyms, and real-world scenarios. her tests are easy as long as youre attentive and attend her lectures. cant get an A if you rely on just her notes. however, she gives hints on what to study & is always open to questions after class"
20,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3310H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KRISTIN,SUPE,"Supe cares very much for her students and is passionate about the material she teaches. She is on top of emails and willing to meet with students however she can. Three exams and a research project are the major grades. The project isn't bad, but the exams can be difficult if you don't study. Attendance is not mandatory, but I would recommend it."
