1,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"This class was the hardest class I took this semester but also my favorite. Dr. Petrov is genuinely passionate about the subject and very knowledgeable, he's also pretty funny and manages to make even the most boring topics interesting to learn about. It is a lot of reading/taking notes but if you keep up with it it's not too bad! I'd recommend it."
2,4.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"I loved this class even with all the quizzes. The little check in quizzes every lecture really helped me learn the material. You can drop 8 quizzes and one exam(including the final). He really cares about what he's teaching and it is a super cool class if you're interested. If you want an easy A pick another prof, but I loved learning from Petrov"
3,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"Despite the ratings here, I think Professor Petrov is one of the best psych professors in OSU. He ensures that you truly understand the material, and spares no effort in teaching you. He's extremely passionate about the subject. His syllabus was very well organized and his grading was fair. Anyone would be lucky to have him as a teacher."
4,5.0,3.0, 3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"I was intimated to take this class due to the low ratings on here, but I actually really, really enjoyed him as my professor. He not only was funny and kind, but could teach the material in a concise way and made everything very objective so that there was no confusion with grading. "
5,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"I love Professor Petrov's class. He's always ready to help, provides great resources, and his lectures are engaging. The quizzes are frequent and the pre-class readings are many, but they prepare you well for the exams. His passion for the subject and dedication to his students is what makes this course amazing. Overall, he's a great professor."
6,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"Not sure if it is a cultural disconnect but Professor Petrov is very verbally disrespectful to the attendees of his lectures. Insinuating a lack of basic knowledge to a room full of people is not very conducive to a healthy learning environment. 
Read the textbook and required readings and you'll be fine. "
7,4.0,5.0, PSY3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"Dr. Petrov assigned almost 50 pages a class, and we had a class quiz every class and an outside quiz after every class. Exams were not that hard if you came to class & paid attention, but it was just A LOT of reading & work. He expects you to memorize charts & schematics (of memory paths, for example) I'm not a math guy, so the cog. part was hard. "
8,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"Man I didn't expect his rating to be so low here... I've had difficult profs but he is definitely not one of them. Detailed study guide, well prepared & organized lecture & materials. On the overlapped content with my PSYCH3513, Dr. Petrov's explanation is better. He is one of the few professors that can catch my attention throughout the lectures."
9,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"- The quizzes he gives to start every class can be very specific and it is hard to remember such details from the required reading
- The lectures are long and cover some irrelevant information

Other than these criticisms, Dr. Petrov is a good professor. If you follow his instructions on how to go about learning the content, you will do fine."
10,2.0,4.0, PSYCH5612,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"Very enthusiastic professor, but course was very content-heavy. In-person lectures were a waste of time; the content we were tested on was in recorded lectures (which were hours longer than the amount of in-class time every week), the textbook, and additional videos/readings. You are expected to memorize everything; I truly mean everything."
11,1.0,5.0, PSYCH5612,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"He's intelligent, funny, likeable, and most of all, a sadistic grader. Grades grad students less harshly than undergrads. Exam averages are C-; not a single grad student got an A and he still didn't curve. Gives 6-8 lectures per week including recorded ones and extreme expectations for time commitments. This is basically a 6 credit hour class."
12,3.0,4.0, PSYCH5612,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"Content is the most amazing thing, but undergrads only had 2 exams, 45 ques 90 points each. total points in class only 280. rest of the points come from lame online quizzes that don't help you but you'll get 100% on most. Doesn't finish the material in class, so makes us watch his online video lectures, read the textbook chapter, and do discussion"
13,1.0,4.0, PSY3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"I dropped this class 2 weeks in. I saw these ratings but needed the class so I gave it a try and quickly regretted it. His lectures are messy and hard to understand. The content was so dry and he made 0 effort to make it bearable. After the quizzes, I dipped. Don't even bother with this guy, take a different prof."
14,1.0,3.0, PSYCH5612,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"This teacher is possibly the worst teacher that I have ever had the misfortune of having to be taught by. Petrov was never consistent with the due dates of his modules, which was contradictive of his syllabus. For example our final module was posted on Friday 12/4/2020 and due on Saturday along with the previous weeks module. Don't take his class!"
15,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"Yeah, this class is not it. Try to get a different professor for 3312. Gives quizzes at the beginning and end of every lecture, and his lectures are incredibly confusing and uninteresting. The content is already a little confusing to begin with and his explanations do absolutely nothing expect make it more confusing. Would not recommend."
16,1.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"He is literally all over the place when he teaches. He goes back and forth on all the slides. Then there are not only 1 quiz but basically two quizzes every day in class, one is at the beginning of class and another at the end. Im sure he knows what he is talking about and seems like a nice guy but is just such a horrible educator."
17,1.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"I really hated his class. He quizzes on the material he is supposed to cover in class, before class. The quizzes aren't easy, so you have to understand the material before coming. They are a big part of your grade. Then he spends too much time explaining easy things and makes them over-complicated. It's more confusing to pay attention than to not."
18,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,This class was a nightmare. Make sure to read the book and review the slides before class because there are quizzes at the beginning and end of each class that ask specific and advanced questions. Study literally every assigned page of the textbook for exams because he asks about topics that were never discussed in lecture but appeared in the book.
19,1.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,"This class is not worth the stress, I would not recommend. The professor is all over the place and makes no sense. If you zone out for five seconds you're lost for the rest of the lecture. The book is boring to read, but important because he asks questions on exams that were not covered in lecture. He also gives a quiz every single day of class."
20,4.0,4.0, PSYCH612,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDER,PETROV,Alex is knowledgeable and funny. I took the intro and advanced cognitive science class with him in 2012. I was a computer science major so some of the stuff many people find difficult was probably easier for me.
