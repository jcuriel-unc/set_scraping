1,4.0,3.0, PSY3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,Really sweet professor. He's knowledgable and kind. Due to his age he is bad with technology and doesn't post notes online AT ALL. The exams are based on the class content so you can't get away with not going to class! You have to write 6 papers but they aren't difficult. I'd recommend this class with this Prof but there is some effort involved.
2,4.5,3.0, PSY3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"A very interesting class, and he made it easy to learn and stayed intrigued with. You have to read the book, because a lot shows up on the exams, which you will do more than fine on if you go to class for notes (not posted online, so you have to go every time), and read over the book material. Really great class, and I recommend him to all."
3,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,Dr. Montemayor was a great prof and I loved attending class. He was funny and kept things interesting but the tests were super hard. Reading the book is VERY important and without reading you definitely won't do well. There are no other grades besides 3 exams and a project so it was hard to get your grade up if you did poorly.
4,3.5,2.0, 4555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"Really nice old man, interested in what he is teaching and makes if fun sometimes; test questions a little ambiguous"
5,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"Though Dr. Montemayor doesn't post class notes and reading is completely necessary, I enjoyed this class and his teaching style. The notes were not too extensive and easy to jot down in class. He is a really nice guy who is very willing to give help. He words his test questions weird, but as long as you go to class and read (a must) you'll do fine."
6,4.5,3.0, PSYCH4551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"I took 4551 & 4555 with him this semester. Attendance isn't mandatory, but it does help a lot to attend. His exams are pretty difficult as well, but as long as you have a general idea of the studies presented in class, you'll be fine.  He also has an awesome curve.  I failed the 1st exam horribly and still ended up with a B. overall, good prof."
7,3.5,4.0, PSYCH4555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"The class and material were interesting, but I found that his lectures could get really tedious, and his exams were extremely difficult. He words things in a confusing way, and I often found things on the tests that were not discussed in the book or in lecture."
8,5.0,3.0, PSYCH555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"Montemayor is a fantastic prof. His lectures are easy to follow and very interesting and he does his best to have discussions with the class. He's always willing to help with class work or anything you want to talk about. Reading the book is a must, though. Tests are half lecture, half text book material. Overall he's amazing!"
9,5.0,4.0, PSYCH555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,I thought this class was fantastic.  Dr. Monetmayor is very interesting and presents the information very clearly.  Reading the book is a must and the tests are challenging but I would definitely recommend this class.
10,5.0,3.0, PSYCH551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"Dr. Montemayor is absolutely wonderful. He is entertaining, interesting, and always open to discussion. He will answer any questions for you after class and he posts all of his powerpoints online. Although he does not take attendance, I would highly recommend attending his lectures. And reading the book is a must! Take his class if you can."
11,4.5,3.0, PSYCH551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,The material itself is great!  He presents the material in an entertaining way.  The tests are really hard even if you read the book.  I ended up with a B and went to class every day and asked questions.  Still I would recommend this class!
12,4.0,4.0, PSYCH551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"He was a good professor.  I learned a lot from him, but the class itself is hard.  You have to read the book but there is no indication of what you'll be tested over."
13,3.0,4.0, PSYCH551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"The class was okay. Lectures not posted online, mostly studies and their results. Exams a lot harder than lecture, lots of material from the book. Not a lot of guidance for what to expect on the exam, but two small easy papers help your grade a little bit. Probably my least favorite class I took this quarter but it definitely could have been worse."
14,4.0,4.0, PSYCH555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"I love Dr. Montemayor. He's a really good teacher and you will learn alot from him and not be bored. You do have to go to his lectures because he doesn't like to put up slides online. You do have to read the book, his tests are are based half on lecture and half on the book. It's not an easy A but any of his classes are definetely worth it."
15,3.5,4.0, PSYCH555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,I took 551 with this guy and it was hard but i still did well and liked it. Now 555 is way hard. The text book is just a regular book. and he makes it sound like he'll pull obvious things from it but there were questions on things i didn't even remember reading. I'm not saying don't take the class cause it is interesting. But be ready to study.
16,3.5,5.0, PSYCH551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"Very funny and interesting guy. His lectures are easy to pay attention to, and very helpful for the exams. His exams, however, are ridiculous and very hard. In his 20 years of teaching, he's only handed out 3 perfect scores on the exams. Reading the text and studying his notes thoroughly is a good way to go."
17,4.0,4.0, PSYCH551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"The class wasn't all that interesting, but was required by my major. He's a nice guy with a great sense of humor that keeps the class interesting. You do need the book for sure though. He uses an open discussion format in lecture and many things in the text will be on the exams but not covered in class."
18,2.0,4.0, PSYCH551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"This class would be easy if you had the time to put into it but I would advise not to take it with three other classes. Very nit picky about exam questions. I second this comment to a tee: ""He doesn't take attendance ... didn't leave much of an impression on me."""
19,4.5,3.0, PSYCH555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"He's a cool guy. I appreciated that he didn't just straight out lecture but asked us our thoughts and answered questions as he went along. Interesting material as well. I didn't find his exams as hard as some of the other comments are saying, but do make sure you read the assigned readings. Good class, good professor."
20,4.5,4.0, PSY551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RAYMOND,MONTEMAYOR,"Great professor.  Lots of interesting material about teenagers.  Funny stories.  Grades on the curve, so your grade depends on what other people get.  Fair, but hard"
