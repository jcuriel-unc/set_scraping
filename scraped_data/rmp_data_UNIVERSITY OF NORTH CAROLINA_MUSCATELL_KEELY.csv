1,5.0,3.0, NSCI570,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEELY,MUSCATELL,"Words can't describe my love for Keely. She is so sweet and really cares about her students. She wants you to learn and class is not about the grades. She takes a more unorthodox approach to class, there's no textbook and class is all discussion based."
2,5.0,3.0, PSYC571,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEELY,MUSCATELL,"keely is such a sweet person, and she is a great professor to teach classes on social neuro. she loves the material and answers questions fully. the class is heavily graded on just a few things - a paper, participation, and a quiz. the final was only worth 10%. class discussions are interesting and engaging! lots of reading, journal articles mostly"
3,5.0,3.0, PSYC490,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEELY,MUSCATELL,Dr. Muscatell is super smart and respected by students. Really enjoyed her lectures and was glad to be exposed to social neuroscience (a new and exciting field). Readings are usually long but most are interesting. Would have liked to read things other than journal articles all semester though (which I think she's changing). Highly recommend!
