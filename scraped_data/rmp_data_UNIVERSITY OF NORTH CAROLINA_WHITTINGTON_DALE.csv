1,3.5,3.0, ENVR610,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DALE,WHITTINGTON,"Dales class is excellent, if you do most of the readings. His class in the past required more assignments but when I took it recently there were only 4 assignments plus a Final Exam - written. He did appear to be condescending in the beginning of the semester but he's trying to provoke good class conversations. Overall, its a good class."
2,3.0,4.0, PLAN785,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DALE,WHITTINGTON,"Dale is very smart and eloquent. Unfortunately, to put it mildly, he is not a nice person. He has no qualms about putting you down in front of other students. And he has a very condescending tone. And he is an extremely poor advisor to his grad students. If you're thinking about working with him, proceed with caution. You've been warned. Good luck."
