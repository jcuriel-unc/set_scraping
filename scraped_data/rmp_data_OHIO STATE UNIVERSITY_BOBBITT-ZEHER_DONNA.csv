1,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL3487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DONNA,BOBBITT-ZEHER,Great professor. She takes her time to explain everything.
2,4.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DONNA,BOBBITT-ZEHER,"Her class was interesting and went by pretty fast. We had plenty class discussions but never put anyone on the spot if they didn't want to contribute. Attendance is important, its worth it anyway. Only one paper, there is a lot of reading for short quizzes, easy to pass them. Exams are mult choice but rather long. Over all I would take her again."
