1,3.0,2.0, SOCI111,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"He's not bad as a professor. Just follow the syllabus and do your homework, go take his class and you'll be fine."
2,4.0,2.0, SOCI111,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"Professor Guo truly cares about his students. He gave us countless opportunities for review for the midterm and engages with students well in class. Lectures can be a bit boring, but it is not hard at all and he's a great guy! I'd take it again!"
3,2.0,4.0, SOCI277,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"He is very kind. The exams are take home and he curves but I can not express how difficult they are and they are very poorly worded. Hardest take home exam of all time!

His accent is thick so its hard to understand his lectures 75% of the time but he is patient and respectful and professional. The material is interesting. DO NOT BUY THE BOOKS!"
4,3.0,2.0, SOCI111,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"While Guang is very nice, and obviously cares about this subject a lot- this class has very few grades. The only tests are the midterm and final, which are both online and open note but there are some hard questions. However the reading notes are easy and boost your grade a decent bit. I'd recommend taking if you actually like sociology"
5,1.0,3.0, SOCI277,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"Most manipulative, disrespectful professor at this school. The class was fairly easy and exams were curved, however even if you attend class every single day and participate generously, the entire class will get a C for participation and no, he will not tell you why. And he will be belligerent and condescending when you ask! Seriously avoid him."
6,1.0,5.0, SOCI111,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"One of the worst classes I've ever taken. The entire time he'll try to paint the class as easy and straightforward, however that is far from the truth. You're graded on two tests practically (midterm/final) and some bs participation grade he doesn't explain to you. The tests are EXTREMELY wordy and hard. Overall terrible class in my opinion."
7,2.0,1.0, SOCI111,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"If you need a study hall, take Soci 111 with Guang. He talks a bunch and doesn't really say a whole lot. Got so much work done in this class though. Final and midterm were pretty easy but some questions either make no sense or are about things we didn't learn. Readings could be long but a good chunk of your grade is based off reading notes Not bad"
8,2.0,3.0, SOCI111,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"This class was awful. He makes his tests insanely hard. Even though they are open note, the questions ask about very specific topics or facts that cannot even be found in the PowerPoints. The reading notes are easy and help boost your grade, but the tests are so heavily weighted that it does not help much."
9,4.0,2.0, SOCI277,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,Really sweet guy. He's super excited about the topics evident in his lectures and the assigned readings. He really just wants his students to pass. The tests and final were open note and the answers were always in the lecture slides. I definitely would take the class again because the topics were also really interesting.
10,4.0,1.0, SOCI277,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"Professor Guo is obviously passionate about the subject, though his lectures can get boring. The tests are open-laptop, but you need to be familiar with the readings. It's an easy class that I would recommend to anyone with a interest in genetics."
11,3.0,3.0, SOCI111,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"Professor Guang Guo is a really sweet man, however, his lectures contain little to no information that will be on the test. The tests are open-note but the questions are extremely specific."
12,2.0,4.0, SOCI111,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"Mr. Guo was a really nice guy, but his class was messed up. He often repeats things that don't need to be repeated and his answers never actually answer your questions. He claims that the midterm and the final are easy, but they are insanely hard, even though it's open everything (and I studied hard). It was a miracle that I got an A."
13,3.0,3.0, SOCI111,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"I actually enjoyed Prof. Guos class! Though his lectures were a bit everywhere, he was very kind after class and obviously wants us to pass. The tests given are a bit difficult, but other grades given help balance that out. Overall, hes a nice guy, though I can see why people find the class a bit boring. An easy A if you do whats needed."
14,1.0,3.0, SOCI111,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"If you asked me what this class was about I couldn't tell you. The second half of this class was reading random articles (half of them were his own). The class was a joke, we all just did nothing because he couldn't teach us anything. And the tests are on random facts that he said during class that a lot of the times had nothing to do with class."
15,3.0,1.0, SOCI11,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"He spends class talking about powerpoints and having students give presentations. The reading/ homework was easy and usually took less than an hour. He does not have many grades (only 5 things), so tests are important but tend to be open note. Overall, it was an easy class for my first semester of college."
16,1.0,5.0, SOCI69,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"Freshmen, beware! The seminar is basically just reading papers. In class Dr. Guo clicks between a few ppts and says a lot while saying nothing. The grade is based on three exams which make no sense. He is not understanding of test errors and refuses to see that his questions are horrible. I've learned nothing and am so stressed about my grade."
17,2.0,5.0, SOCI69,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"Class is basically a student presenting homework, which is an extremely long and technical research paper. A majority of the grade is the midterm and final, both of which are extremely difficult. He makes the answer choices all the same, and manages to have grammatical errors everywhere. This was harder than MATH 231 or CHEM 102. I do not recommend"
18,3.5,2.0, SOCI11,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GUANG,GUO,"He tries ot make the class interesting but by the end of the semester I got so sick of hearing about his Princeton days + ivy league rankings. I had to restrain myself from saying ""go and teach at Princeton, then!...but I didn't"
