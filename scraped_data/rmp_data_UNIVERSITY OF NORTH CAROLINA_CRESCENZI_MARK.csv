1,5.0,2.0, POLI150H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Easily one of the best professors I've had at UNC. Assigned readings are important and coincide with homework assignments, but pretty easy grader and the activities help to understand class content. Lots of class discussion, he really cares about his students and respects what they have to say. If you can get into a class with him, take it!"
2,3.0,3.0, POLI150H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"This class was alright. It wasn't my favorite, but I didn't hate it. The class has a ton of reading and several papers that you'll have to finish in a night or two. Most classes are lecture heavy, but you do a couple of fun interactive activities. The prof is super understanding and kind, the material is just not my favorite."
3,5.0,2.0, POLI150H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Crescenzi was awesome. Easily one of the best professors at UNC. Seriously, any class you can take with him, take it. You can tell he genuinely loves teaching and cares for his students. Felt really out of depth going into this course but felt fully prepared for the exams just from readings/class discussions"
4,5.0,3.0, POLI150H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Professor Crescenzi is one of the best professors I've had! He is so caring, funny, and engaging in class. His deep knowledge and wide range of experience in international politics make his lectures very interesting. He is a very easy grader, but just be prepared to write a lot of essays. I know he loves helping students find opportunities, too!"
5,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Professor Crescenzi is the best. His course was very well adapted to the pandemic, he's understanding of all perspectives, and gives room to express your own beliefs and thoughts freely. The course structure was mostly asynchronous and super flexible. The grading seems TA dependent but his TA's are awesome. Take this class!"
6,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,Professor Crescenzi is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. He really cares about his students and the course material. He was really understanding with the pandemic and tried to accommodate the class with the needs of students. I highly recommend taking a course with him if you can.
7,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Professor Crescenzi is an underrated teacher at UNC. Was understanding of the situations of students during the pandemic and took it into account throughout the semester with syllabus adjustments. Lectures were rather interesting as he often tied it to current events. All assignments are graded by your TA, so the experience can vary by recitation."
8,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Prof Crescenzi is one of the best professors I've had. He was very understanding and has done so much to make the learning experience more enjoyable and less stressful in light of the course going online due to covid. The class is fairly straightforward, and he makes the material super interesting and well spaced-out. Would definitely take again!"
9,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Prof. Crescenzi is the chair of the Political Science Department, and he is truly a gem. He is so kind, understanding, and down to earth. He wants students to succeed and will work with you to ensure you do. He is very well read and knowledgeable but is purposeful in making sure his students are receptive. I would definitely take his class again!"
10,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,Great Class! I love Professor Crescenzi. He did so good giving us the perfect introduction to international relations. I had this class online because of Corona. He was so caring and really helped all of us out. I loved this class!
11,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Prof. Crescenzi is one of the best I've had at UNC. He's SO incredibly kind and was extremely accommodating with COVID. He's passionate about what he teaches and genuinely cares about students. Class consisted of a midterm, final, and 8 one-page writing assignments graded by your TA. Take a class with Crescenzi if you can!!!"
12,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Prof Crescenzi is one of the kindest and most empathetic educators I've ever seen and taking his class made this entire online semester that much more enjoyable. He encourage feedback like no prof I've seen before. He's reminds of a skinnier political science genius Santa Clause. If you get the chance to be in one of his classes, go for it!"
13,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Great professor- as a senior I have NEVER seen a prof actually accommodate students on this level. Though there are weekly writing reports, there is no central essay. My TA graded somewhat harshly but turned out ok in the end. Midterm probs relates more to TA. Mark always checks in and actually hears students, it's beyond."
14,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Asynchronous. Love this professor & can't wait to take another class with him. Acknowledged the pandemic & our stress & lightened our load to the extent possible. 8-10/16 1-page writing assignments are counted, one midterm, one final, participation. I liked my TA & I liked the material. A little boring at times but recommend taking online."
15,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"THE MOST AMAZING PROFESSOR !!! He actually acknowledges that we are in a pandemic right now !! Not only does he want each student to succeed, but he shows that he cares by constant encouragement throughout the semester in emails/Zoom meetings !! He is always available and helpful during office hours, easy to talk to, and has great lectures !!!"
16,5.0,5.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"Prof. Crescenzi is amazing! So understanding of students' needs, good lectures. Super knowledgeable but knows how to teach an intro class in a way that is perceptible and interesting. This class is not hard to get a good grade in if you do the work. It gives you a great toolkit to continue learning about POLI!"
17,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,Crescenzi is the best prof ever. He was so accommodating because of COVID and online learning. For example he basically cancelled our final which relieved so much stress off me. His lectures were super helpful and the writing assignments were not difficult. He gave us so many opportunities to get As. And the TAs are all awesome. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!
18,5.0,1.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,Dr. Crescenzi is awesome. i personally found the class really boring but that probably bc it was asynchronous! prof made this class a little better by giving really clear and helpful lectures and being super understanding. the online class is very well designed and adapted
19,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,Mark Crescenzi is an angel. The material can be heavy but he breaks everything down as much as possible in his lectures and is readily available outside of class to discuss anything you don't understand. He is one of my best-adapted professors to the online format and is still always willing to adjust assignments and exams to help students. Async.
20,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MARK,CRESCENZI,"His lectures are interesting and he is very accessible outside of class. He adjusted to online classes extremely well and he lightened the workload wherever he could to help us out. The class does have a lot of reading, but it's not too difficult and you'll do fine if you keep up with the reading and lectures. I could not recommend him more."
