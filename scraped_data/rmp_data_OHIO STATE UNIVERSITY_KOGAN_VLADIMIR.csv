1,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4127,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,Dr. Kogan is now of the most interesting and well-thought professors I have ever had. He is incredible knowledgeable and interested in his students success. The written exams are very long so make sure to start them early but he is a fairly gracious grader.
2,1.0,5.0, POLISCI4130,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,Spends all his time complaining online about unions and talking about how he deserves to make much more money than public school teachers.
3,5.0,2.0, POLISCI4125,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"Can't say enough good things about Kogan. Probably the most organized prof at OSU, responds in 2 minutes to emails, everything is very clear in syllabus. Can get extra cred for speaking in class, asks thought provoking questions. Exams are half take home, half online and aren't very hard. End of sem group project is engaging and fun. 10/10!"
4,1.0,3.0, POLITSC3115,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"Very closed minded and hard to talk to. Some people just view themselves as too self important and he is one of them. You'll do well if you agree with him tho, just don't dare to have a differing opinion or outlook on a topic because MY GOD how dare you?!"
5,5.0,3.0, POLISCI4125,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,Professor Kogan was the best professor I had during my time at OSU. He is really passionate about the subjects he lectures and keeps you engaged. His involvement in local politics and the examples he provides in class from his advocacy efforts prove that he cares about what he is teaching. 10/10!
6,5.0,5.0, POLISCI4125,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,Professor Kogan is really kind and extremely intelligent. He makes lectures easy to understand and always keeps them interesting. The downside of taking his class was that the readings are not easy and attending class is a must (otherwise your grade drops). The exams are also challenging and you have to plan ahead of time before starting them.
7,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4125,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,Vlad is a political scholar and is respected as such. You must show up to class everyday having read the assigned readings. Gives extra credit every time you go to office hours or participate in lecture.
8,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4130,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,Law & Politics class is a great option for anyone considering law school. There's lots of reading and exams (take home) take a few days to complete. This class is a lot of work but there are so many points available that you can miss a day or fail a quiz & get points elsewhere. It'll help you decide if law school is for you or not!
9,1.0,5.0, POLISCI4130,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"This man kogan is a absolute mad man do not take his class and Im saying this with a B. His group projects in a online setting is so stressful it feels like a dream thats how bad it is, his take home portion of exams are extremely long so do not try and do it the day before its due. Absolute nightmare and he does not care."
10,1.0,2.0, POLISCI4125,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,Super unaccommodating. I am in his class in the midst of the Covid-19 outbreak and somehow the class has gotten more annoying. He has a group project with 9 people so its impossible to meet and he doesn't give class time to do so and hasn' canceled it. There have also been at least 4 assignments not on the syllabus at all that he expects you to do.
11,1.0,3.0, POLISCI4130,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"He is unaccomodating. He has a clear class structure--great, but if you miss class, he refuses to let you make it up. Even for excused absences. Participation IS graded. Every single class. His ""take-home"" exam takes 7 hours to complete. If you miss tophat by 5 seconds he will not let you make it up. Dreaded going to class."
12,1.0,3.0, POLISCI4130,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"Professor is not understanding of outside circumstances that may require you to miss class, even if its excused. Participation is graded in a large lecture and if you miss Tophat he will not let you make it up. How to do the take home exams were not something ever taught in class and would only loosely apply to lectures."
13,5.0,4.0, POLSC4130,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"Vlad has teaching down to a science. The course is a lot of work but if you do it all you should have no problem getting an A. He takes so many grades that its easy to bounce back if you do poorly on the reading quizzes. Participation is extra credit. Exams are takehome, a lot of work, but if you follow the rubric you'll get an A. Highly recommend"
14,4.0,2.0, POLITSC4127,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"Vlad is a great professor. His course requires a decent amount of work, but it's very interesting. Some units were more stimulating than others , though. It's also worth noting that a lot of extra credit is given out. Overall, I would highly recommend this course."
15,1.0,1.0, POLISCI4130,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"Professor Kogan does not care about his students. He refuses to give students with disabilities accommodations. I would not take this class again. I am doing well in the class, but the lack of respect for students, especially students with disabilities, is discouraging and makes succeeding in the class difficult. Course content is interesting."
16,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4127,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"Although I have not yet completed the entire course, Professor Kogan's ""Governing Urban America"" is the best class I have taken at OSU. The class is straightforward. As long as you put in the effort, you will undoubtedly succeed. The lectures are highly informative and sometimes comedic. It is clear he loves to teach this class. Take this class!"
17,4.0,3.0, POLISCI4125,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"One of the best classes I've taken at OSU. Participation and attendance matter for your grade. Class is very structured with reading quizzes (which you can do online) and a group project. He uses a lot of videos to aid his lectures, which I found helpful. Overall Vlad Kogan is a very good, straightforward teacher."
18,4.0,3.0, POLISCI4125,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"Dr. Kogan gives you a solid, no nonsense class. He is very smart, has interesting lectures, and his expectations are very clear. As long as you show up every day and pay attention you can easily get an A. Class is easy if you do everything, reading quizzes every day make up 25% of our grade and participation is another 20 so don't skip consistently"
19,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4127,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,I really loved this class! Would highly recommend going on the police ride along. gives a lot of extra credit and tests are taken online
20,4.0,4.0, POLISCI4130,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VLADIMIR,KOGAN,"Prof. Kogan is a clear grader and an overall solid lecturer. Although the attendances are not mandatory, it is in your best interest to attend as many of the lectures as possible because they can give you a clearer view and a better understanding on the course material which are mainly cases that will be a huge part on the midterm and the final."
