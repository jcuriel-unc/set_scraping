1,4.0,4.0, PUBHHMP3610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIKA HARITOS,PAUL,"Before this semester I looked Dr. Paul up and became very scared due to the reviews. However she made many adjustments to the course this semester to improve the class. The final project seems daunting and time consuming, however I feel like it was very valuable to my future career in public health. Overall she is a great professor. "
2,1.0,3.0, PUBHHMP3610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIKA HARITOS,PAUL,Tis class had so many components to it. Dr. Paul made assignments harder than they needed to be and she graded just as harder or even harder. We had a huge group project and our honestly did really well but she graded us harshly and a lot of people's grades drop at the end. The public health classes are easy but this one was hard for no reason.
3,1.0,5.0, PUBHHMP3610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIKA HARITOS,PAUL,Test questions were based off of arbitrary facts briefly mentioned within lectures. This class was made so much harder than it needed to be. Major grade-changing projects were required to be completed in groups (even with the pandemic). Not accommodating.
4,1.0,4.0, PUBHHMP3610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIKA HARITOS,PAUL,"Do not take this class with Dr. Paul. The material of the class is not difficult, however, she makes quizzes/exams much more difficult than they need to be. Her lectures are dry and you must be paying attention 100% of the time to get the needed material for quizzes/exams otherwise you will not find it in the textbook/anywhere else."
5,1.0,4.0, PUBHHMP3610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIKA HARITOS,PAUL,"She is the worst professor I have ever had. She makes the content of this class way harder than it has to be. She gives no slack on grading. Very limited instructions and does not allow room for error even when she is at fault. Grades extremely hard, even discussion posts. Your best effort still will not be enough."
