1,4.5,4.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,FABIO,LEITE,This class wasn't too difficult. Took a lot of my time to complete the assignments (5 total). Two exams. I don't recommend the text because it's just a bunch of case studies that you go over in class. I highly recommend you going to class or you won't pass (seriously). Take notes! He's very intelligent and not as bad as people lead on. Great guy.
