2,1.5,3.0, PUBHHBP7562,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIRA,KATZ,"Condescending.Always acts like she is 'out to get you'. She is smart, I'll give you that. But its gone to her head a bit. Being smart doesn't matter if you can't communicate effectively with your students."

4,1.0,3.0, PHHBHP,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIRA,KATZ,She is definitely a bully.  I have never had an instructor who treated students as terribly as she does.  Individuals quit the program specifically because of her.
5,1.0,3.0, PUBHLHBHP,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MIRA,KATZ,"If she decides she doesn't like you, watch out; it will be her mission to make your life miserable.  If she really does not like you, her criticism and discrimination will continue after you have completed her course because she will make sure to tell everyone in the department how terrible she thinks you are. She is a bully."
