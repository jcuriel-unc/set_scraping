1,2.0,4.0, POLITSC3500,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"Only graded on 4 assignments (30% Midterm, 30% Final, 20% Reading Quizzes, 20% Group Project). Extremely dry, boring content, kind of assumes everyone has an advanced level of knowledge even though there are no pre reqs to the class. Exams are unnecessarily difficult - both the midterm and final had to be curved by 20 points each."
2,3.0,4.0, POLITSC3500,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"Final grade is only based on two exams, reading quizzes, and a group project. The class is pretty difficult, he had to curve the midterm and final for a decent amount of points, think 10-20. The lectures can be boring but he does a decent job teaching, willing to answer questions, and is overall a pretty chill professor. "
3,4.0,1.0, POLITSC1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,Class was super easy. One reading quiz a week which was common sense if you read the book. Curves the midterm and final a LOT. Highly recommend for a GE and he was super nice. 
4,4.0,2.0, POLITSC3115,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"Lecture could be dry at times, but I still liked this class. Just a midterm and final (both administered online), final paper, and pop tophat quizzes based on the readings. He has students best interests at heart and everything was pretty straightforward."
5,5.0,3.0, POLITSC3115,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"Alex was an excellent lecturer. Insightful, even handed, and willing to answer questions and have a discussion. The class was based mostly on the midterms, final and paper, but he gave a generous curve and graded fairly. I really enjoyed this class."
6,1.0,4.0, PSCI3115,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"This class is unnecessarily tedious and difficult. Endless amount of policies to choose from to study, and this prof seemingly picks the most boring topics possible. Doesn't give clear guidelines or content of exams, the quizzes don't even match the readings, and was pretentious with occasional out of pocket things said. -900/10, don't recommend."
7,5.0,2.0, POLITSC1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"This class was pretty easy, if you took high school gov you're off to a good start. I really liked Prof Acs, and though I probably could've gotten an A while skipping some lectures, I genuinely enjoyed being there. Classes kind of feel like a casual chat but he does teach the material well. Funny, chill, will lightly make fun of people."
8,2.0,5.0, POLITSC3115,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"Many questions are completely ambiguous or have conflicting information which makes the midterm luck-based. Everyone ran out of time, average was initially an 80%. Now it's a 78%, and we're confused whether he curved it down? No lecture recs, mandatory attendance, midterms open at 9AM for 1 hour, & no slides released until weeks after his lectures."
9,5.0,1.0, POLITSC1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"Professor Acs is a really great professor. He is clear about what his expectations are for your assignments. There are 2 midterms, 1 final. Lots of extra credit opportunity and he also curves almost all the exams. He is very smart and yet is easy to learn from as he explains things flawlessly. He is also funny and really nice!"
10,4.0,4.0, POLITSC3115,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"Aces clearly loves the information he is teaching, the class had only three test- which he curved and extra credit was able to be given. There was a textbook- but I never bought it. I put this class on the back burner of 18 credit hours- not that it is easy, just never any commitment besides the three exams."
11,1.0,5.0, POLITSC3115,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,Your grade is determined based on the final and midterm exams. The exams are extremely hard he had to curve grades 12% because a lot of our class failed. Lectures are really boring. Wouldnt recommend this course or teacher. This intro class definitely hurt my gpa. Take with another professor if you can!
12,3.0,4.0, POLSCI3115,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"The only grade in the class is the midterm and final, which isn't an easy exam, but he does curve it! I would take it with someone else if possible, but have learned a lot. It is an intro level course, but is much harder than that. Other students in my class do not like him, but I do not mind him."
13,3.0,4.0, POLSCI3115,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"The only grade in the class is the midterm and final, which isn't an easy exam, but he does curve it! I would take it with someone else if possible, but have learned a lot. It is an intro level course, but is much harder than that."
14,3.0,3.0, POLISC4115,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALEX,ACS,"He's a great guy who loves this topic, but you don't actually get through much content in the class because he talks about it all a little too much. Graded by three response papers, two exams, one final paper, and some reading quizzes. You really need to do the reading and it's very unclear exactly what he expects you to do in the papers."
