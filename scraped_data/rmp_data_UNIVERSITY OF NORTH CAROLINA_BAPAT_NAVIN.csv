2,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,"Awesome lectures with tons of info. Grade is based off of a few papers and online exams, so while this class requires a lot of reading, there is not too much pressure or time constraints. He also brings in amazing guest lecturers. "
3,5.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,"Professor Bapat is amazing. Attendance isn't mandatory for lectures(although his lectures are really good! So would recommend going). There is a lot of reading, but I briefly skimmed it and a lot of times I didn't look at the book at all and I did really well in the class. Not too difficult if you put some effort into it! Loved this class."
4,4.0,2.0, POLI452,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,Highly enjoyed this class and Prof. Bapat. He's a great lecturer and I learned so much from his class. It is not hard to do well if you do the work and put in effort for the few assignments. Highly recommend!
5,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,"Professor Bapat was very organized and clear about what was expected.

6,4.0,1.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,"Professor Bapat was a great and very interesting lecturer. The class isn't hard if you go to class and put effort into your papers. He actually has a range of due dates for the essays, so don't wait until the end of the semester. Just make sure you attend recitation and do the reading for it. "

8,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,"Dr. Bapat is the best professor I've had at UNC! He is very knowledgeable in the topic while making his lectures personable and engaging. The class consists of two essays, two midterms, and a final, all of which are open note and online. Getting an A in this class was very attainable and I also felt like I learned a lot from both Bapat and my TA."
9,5.0,1.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,"Bapat has been the best Political Science professor I have had at UNC. His 150 class is extremely easy while still being comprehensive. The course consists of 2 papers, 2 midterms, and a final, all of which are taken online at home. He is funny and has great stories, would recommend to anybody."
10,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,Professor Bapat is not only extremely knowledgeable about the material but he genuinely cares about his students.

I actually learned quite a bit from this course and would highly recommend it.

12,3.0,2.0, POLI452,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,"You can tell Prof Bapat is smart and intelligent. But his lectures are mostly timelines of political events. Studying requiring a lot of memorization, he also did not give much guidelines on the final research project. "

16,5.0,2.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,"Bapat was awesome. He gave great lectures that were engaging and he was so clearly passionate about the subject that it was great to listen to. Attendance isn't required, but I would recommend bc the topic is so interesting. Graded off of 2 papers, participation, 2 midterms & a final, but the class is overall not hard. I would definitely take again"

18,5.0,1.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,"Best lecturer I have had so far at UNC. He really knows his stuff and his class is so well organized, there are no surprises. The class was SOO easy and he gives you plenty of time to get your stuff done. Exams are open note take home. I would take this class again in a heart beat. "
19,5.0,1.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,"Legit one of the best professors at Chapel Hill. For my class all we had were 2 exams, 2 papers, the midterm, and a weekly recitation (which was canceled half the time)."
20,4.0,3.0, POLI150,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NAVIN,BAPAT,"Grade consisted for two papers (you choose the papers you want to write/their due dates), three exams, and recitation.  Exams were open note, but do prepare for them.  Study lecture slides and readings (helpful for MC and essay section).  Had Parajon for TA.  Make sure you participate well and genuinely contribute to class. Fair essay grader."
