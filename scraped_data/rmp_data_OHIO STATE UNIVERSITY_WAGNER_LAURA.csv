1,5.0,2.0, PSYCH554,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,"Unsure why she has so many bad reviews, her class was one of the easiest 4000-levels I've taken. Laura's a fun person who loves what she does, and her class is about learning concepts and thinking for yourself, not spitting up rote facts. So maybe if you're a memorize-the-study-guide-for-the-test type, she'd be bad for you?"
2,3.0,4.0, 4554,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,"Lecture is interesting, she makes it very clear what is important to know from the readings/powerpoints. On the tests, however, it's a bit more/ a lot more confusing. She doesn't give study guides or anything, so you're basically forced to memorize. She doesn't always make it clear on tests/homework assignments exactly what she's asking for. "
3,4.5,4.0, PSYCH554,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,"Class was professor's specialization and she was very enthusiastic about it, yet did a good job at presenting things from multiple perspectives without bias. She is also approachable, helpful, and accommodating of circumstances. She can be a tough grader, but if you need help or an extension she is more than willing to accommodate you."
4,4.0,2.0, PSYCH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,"Class wasn't too hard and she puts lectures online so you can print them out. There are quite a few homeworks but they are mostly easy and you get 2 tries on them, so they just boost your grade since the only others are the 2 midterms and a final."
5,2.0,3.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,She doesn't show up to exams and it comes off as though she has very little interest in teaching. Tests have little to do with lectures and can be tricky
6,2.5,4.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,She is very arrogant and does not want to help students... avoid her!!
7,1.5,5.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,this class was horrible. we didnt even use the book in class and all she talked about was her beloved lab. i wouldnt recommend her as a teacher to anyone.
8,1.5,5.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,"She was a HORRIBLE teacher. Gave no notes compared to the text that was covered. No study guide. The class was based on three exams and the extra credit was a joke. She was lazy; that's why we didn't have a study guide AND she never even bothered to show up to give her own exams. I think she needs to be limited to the lab, what she cares about."
9,3.5,3.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,"I liked Prof. Wagner's class. Her lecture notes were on Carmen and matched the book. Exams questions could be a little tricky, but she gave opportunities for extra credit points. I would recommend Psych550 with her."
10,4.0,2.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,"Good teacher. Easy class, didn't use the book at all, but really good information."
11,5.0,5.0, PSY550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,"A really great, interesting class."
12,5.0,5.0, PSY550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,Wagner is the best.  I really loved this course.  She is a great teacher and I really learned a lot.
13,5.0,1.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,"This class is NOT hard.  One midterm, three one page assignments, 40% final.  Go to class, skim the book, notes online.  She is easy to listen to and presents the material in an interesting way.  Easier than some of my GECs.  Would highly recommend."

15,3.5,3.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,"This class was interesting but I just couldn't stay awake a lot of the time. Anyway, teacher does a good job of explaining concepts and trying to get you to understand the big pictures. Multiple choice tests with couple essays makes for a reasonably easy class if you come and pay attention. She also offered extra credit which was nice."
16,2.0,5.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,she was hard. the tests were even harder. the material was interesting but test material hard. lots of reading and testing on book material. did not like the teacher either.
17,3.5,4.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LAURA,WAGNER,"Maybe I took this class too early in my college career, who knows. Even though I was greatly interested in the subject matter, I got something like 60, 67, 66 on the two midterms and final, which constitute 100% of the grade. Class is actually interesting, but the multiple choice is really, really difficult. Actually made me change my major!"
