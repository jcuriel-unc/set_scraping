1,5.0,3.0, PUBHLTH2010,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,FERKETICH,"I literally switched my major to public health after this class. I would say that the time in class is not productive, and most of the homework out of class takes some time to do (1 page writing and 1 easy quiz a week for the most part), but the content is very interesting. We read novels relating to public health. Loved this class and professor"
2,2.0,3.0, PUBHLTH2010,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,FERKETICH,Not difficult but not particularly interesting. Seems generally nice but came off as very condescending in emails and one-ones.

4,5.0,2.0, PUBHLTH2010,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,FERKETICH,"Class consisted of asynchronously watching a lecture and videos each week and then 1 page reflections about what you watch. In person meetings were a lot of cool guest lecturers and discussions about topics. Not very much work, no tests. 1 group research paper and 1 ""final"" project that is really easy"
5,5.0,3.0, PUBHEPI3410H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,FERKETICH,"I took case studies in epidemiology my freshman year and loved having Dr. Ferketich. Even though the class was 3 hours long and in the evenings, I always looked forward to it. She gave group projects, but they were interesting and actually helped us learn the material. She also brought snacks every week."
6,2.0,3.0, PUBHLTH2010,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,FERKETICH,"I heard amazing things about this class, but with the way it is set up I was super disappointed. A different TA teaches each module and each quiz is written completely differently making them hard to study for. Her rubrics and syllabus are extremely vague on projects as well, and asking for clarity from her or the TAs was not helpful at all."
7,5.0,3.0, PUBHEPI3410H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,FERKETICH,"The best class I've taken at Ohio State so far. Small class, about 15 people and totally focused on case studies. For older students, great way to apply what you've learned in other classes. For freshmen, great opportunity to learn from her and students that have been in the program"
