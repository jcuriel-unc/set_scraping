1,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,Very great professor
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"Notes are not online so you have to go to class if you want the notes, which are a lot! You will need the book."
3,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"We had 2 papers, 3 exams and about 12 case studies. I enjoyed the class. She teaches very well. Didnt really need to read the book because her notes were so wonderful. She doesn't post your grades online. She makes you participate in class. She makes attendance mandatory. Overall she was ok."
4,5.0,1.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"Professor Hupp makes every discussion from the textbook very well digested and easy to understand. I found no trouble at all in her class, and even got to skip my final exam (best 3/4) because I had a 110% in the class. Would recommend for a great psychology professor."
5,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"Best professor I've had!  She will explain anything if asked and interacts with the students.  However, there was some homework with two papers and six case studies throughout the semester, but the case studies were an easy grade booster and helpful!  If you take notes, study some, and know the material you'll pass with a good grade."
6,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"Dr. Hupp makes the material easy, and tries to make certain that the class has fun.  She definitely requires you to work for your grade, but she grades fairly."
7,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,Absolutely loved Dr. Hupp! She is a fair grader with great feedback. You will need the book (you will use it for online quizzes & HW). I definitely recommend this class!
8,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"The amount of extra credit is insane. She is super nice and the lectures are very engaging and  interesting. Tests are easy. Lots of material, so you need FLASHCARDS. Looking over the note will not do it. There are like 200 terms per test so I recommend online flashcards so your hands don't hurt. You will get an A if you memorize the material. "
9,4.5,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,Awesome professor. There are 3 tests and 2 easy papers. All tests are easy if you listen to her lectures and take notes. Almost all the test material is from the notes. She posts study guides on Carmen. Her lectures are very understandable. She is very helpful. She gives extra credit opportunities. 
10,4.0,2.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"Interesting class. Lectures were sometimes boring, especially if your the type to read before class. Two easy papers. Tests are simple and to the point, consist of equal multiple choice and short answer. Be sure to attend class she gives 2 points per class. I would recommended her. Easy B, only because I didn't go to all lectures"
11,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"She was amazing!There were a lot of notes, but her lectures were fun. Also, make sure you pay attention to grammar in your papers. Loved her and her class."
12,4.0,4.0, LIFE340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"Dr. Hupp was a good professor. She would be willing to help, however she is a stickler when it comes to the grammar on papers. But the study guide and quizzes were helpful."
13,4.0,4.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,A lot of notes.....Study Guide on Carmen really helps for exams.... really hard grader....she does really try to help her students
14,5.0,3.0, PSYCH540,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"I love Hupp, she's helpful and understanding and unlike some teachers you'll get she really cares about her students learning the material. Had a blast in the class and I am totally going to take her again."
15,4.5,4.0, PSYCH101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,good teacher. has lots of notes. but covers everything needed in class.very nice and funny professor. very open to going off on tangents and class discussions. not an easy class but an enjoyable one. highly recommend.
16,4.5,5.0, PSYCH551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"i just took this class and got an A, it was pretty fun and i loved to hate the case studies. she is funny/nice. i had her look over all my papers, even before the exam. the exams were a little tough (but she def goes over everything on her slides). everything is pretty straightforward. go to class, she now gives 5xc for being on time. shes wonderfu"
17,4.0,5.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,She's my favorite!
18,5.0,4.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,Great Professor!!!
19,3.0,5.0, PSYCH314,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JULIE,HUPP,"This is a brain dump class.  There are so many notes and so many chapters covered per test (10 chapters) that it is hard to decide what is important.  Memorize, memorize, memorize.. pass the test and then forget it. Anal retentive for sure, but organized and fair... just no life experience to go on."
