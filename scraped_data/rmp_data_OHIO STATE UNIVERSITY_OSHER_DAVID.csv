1,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,OSHER,"Dr. Osher was an amazing professor. Very flexible due to COVID and easy to contact outside of class. Cared about his students and the material he was teaching. Offered a lot of extra credit and took extra time when needed to review confusing topics. Made a relatively boring class much more interesting, the best psych professor I've had so far!"
2,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,OSHER,"LOTS of terms. Heavily learning about anatomy of different senses and how they work, which gets confusing. Class is huge and so not a huge opportunity to learn. Online lectures and the groupme were my best friend. David is super nice and understanding. He really does care about his students but class is boring and difficult if you don't like it."
3,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,OSHER,"He is amazing! The class itself wasn't the most fun, but he tried his best to get people engaged and make it enjoyable. The exams were pretty easy and one of them gets dropped. As long as you do the work you should get an A"
4,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,OSHER,I really enjoyed this class and learned some really cool stuff! he is a kind and helpful professor so definitely reach out to him if you need any help or questions.
5,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,OSHER,"Dr. Osher was awesome. Although I was not interested in the course content and only had to take it for my major, he made it not horrible throughout the semester. He was always willing to go out of his way to help, and also mentioned he will likely make his in person exams open notes. You can tell his enthusiasm on teaching the subject"
6,4.0,1.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,OSHER,"You need to watch the lecture videos for points, but the exams are completely open: youre even allowed to use Google. As long as you put in minimal effort, its easy to get an A."
7,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,OSHER,"Love this dude. He's super chill and helpful, and he very clearly loves the work he does. His lectures were a little difficult to get through online even with 2x speed, but overall, his class was almost always the highlight of my week. As long as you keep up with the work (there's not a lot) and study before tests you should do very well with him!"
8,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,OSHER,"I'm really glad I took his class. For some psych majors it might seem a little difficult since there is a good amount of bio/neuroscience, but I enjoyed it a lot. He covers all kinds of interesting and unexpected things about perception and I learned a lot. He's really enthusiastic and eager to help outside of class. The final was pretty hard"
9,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DAVID,OSHER,"The material could be considered difficult to grasp but his lectures, study guides and overall enthusiasm for the material made it incredibly easy to understand/learn. Not a crazy amount of work outside of class, over all really enjoyed his teaching style/enthusiasm for the subject! 10/10 would recommend sense and perception with him!"
