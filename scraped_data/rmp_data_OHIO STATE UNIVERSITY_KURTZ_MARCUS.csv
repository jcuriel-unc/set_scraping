1,5.0,1.0, POLITSC1165,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,Took this class asynchronous and it was very straightforward. Eight quizzes and three tests were all the grades. There weren't many trick questions and the grading scale allows for leniency (85+ is an A). Would definitely recommend if you need to fill out credit hours.
2,4.0,2.0, POLISCI100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Very concise class. Questions can be tricky but graded on a scale where an A is a 85 or higher so there's breathing room. Overall didn't have to spend much time on this class and never had to interact with Professor Kurtz, but can still recommend this as a 2nd session course."
3,5.0,2.0, POLITSC1165,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Quizzes and tests were the only graded components of this class. If you also get test anxiety, I would not be worried about this. Quizzes/exams were open book/note/lecture. Some questions did make me thinks, but I did not sweat the bulk of them. I recommend this as a GE or GPA booster. It was also a second session, 3 cr. hr course which was sweet."
4,4.0,2.0, POLITSCI1165,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Dr. Kurtz's class is well organized and an easy-A. However, his lectures can be super long and very boring. He'll talk for 10 minutes about something that could be discussed in 2 minutes. The reading for each week is heavy, but you can get away with skimming. Responsive to emails. Would recommend for an easy GE."
5,5.0,4.0, POLITSC1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Professor Kurtz is extremely knowledgable in his field. He has worked extensively in different fields of political science, and doesn't seem to ever be wrong. He is one of the best teachers I have had!"
6,5.0,3.0, POLITSC1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Kurtz knows what he is talking about. You will learn a lot in his course, but you have to pay attention. Attendance isn't recorded, but it's a lot easier to understand the material if you're present. Only had four grades the whole semester (four tests). He answers any questions and is always available. I recommend the professor and the course."
7,3.0,3.0, POLITSC1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"If you like political science, he is the professor for you. But if you are just looking for a GE, there are better options. Lectures can be incredibly boring, but tests are easy & he supplies study guides."
8,5.0,3.0, POLISCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Prof. Kurtz manages to convey information very well. This class was quite difficult, as I only managed to get a C on the first midterm, but after talking to him about it I got my grade up to a B+ by the end of the semester. Very fun class!"
9,3.5,2.0, POLITSC1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Great professor. I just loved the way he talked and it was my most favorite class taken so far. Although an easy GE, he actually made me interested in the subject. I looked forward to every class. Also, it wasn't hard with only a few hours of studying before each midterm."
10,4.5,4.0, POLITSC3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Prof. Kurtz is probably one of the best, if not the best, instructor I've ever had. He's very informed and the love for his subject really comes out. Lectures are not necessary since he posts slides online, but they're so interesting and his lecture really adds to the material/experience. Tests are somewhat difficult, but deservingly so. Recommend!"
11,5.0,2.0, POLISCI1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Took him my first semester here, and by far my favorite professor thus far. Easy going, often makes extra office hours to help students, and funny at times. Gives 3 tests, final exam is a take home essay. Gives study guide with everything to be expected on the test, so if you know you're stuff you will do great. & his grading scale goes by the 20's"
12,5.0,4.0, POLISCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Great professor. He loves what he teaches, which makes lectures more interesting. Material can be pretty tricky at times, but he is very good at explaining it. Exams are hard. He gives you a study guide with anything that might be on it. Overall  he is a great professor but his class is difficult. He knows this and will tries to minimize stress."
13,4.5,2.0, 3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Great professor who is actually interested in teaching. Lots of reading but he explains it all in class. He gives you the questions that are going to be on the midterms, which are super easy. Pay attention in class and you're set  "
14,3.0,4.0, POLITSC1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Super informative. Well spoken, easy to follow. Some complex material at times. Lectures are overall interesting and he keeps your attention (if you care at all about the subject matter). Your grade comes from midterms and exam which are all long answeressay but he tells you what to know and provides study guides!!! Most should get an A or B here!"
15,3.0,4.0, POLISCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"He's a nice guy but his lectures are SOOO boring. The exams are pretty difficult as well. There's two midterms and a take home final, they are mostly IDs and an essay question. He gives the questions that are on the midterms before so that's a positive. Grading is done by the TA."
16,3.5,5.0, POLIS541,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"The Professor is great, but the grading (done by the TA) is unfair and completely subjective.  The exams are ids and essays, and getting an A truly depends on luck.  Seriously, the person next to you might have the exact same answer with ten higher points.  I would recommend this class if you're OK with getting a B for handing in A work."
17,4.5,3.0, PS541,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,Kurtz turns complex hazy topics into something all students can understand. And he manages to do this with humor and interest. He is helpful and loves asking students for opinions. Exams questions are given beforehand but the grading is slightly subjective and tough. Take thorough notes on the computer and you can get by skimming the readings.
18,4.5,4.0, PS541,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,Kurtz is one of those unique teachers in the world who knows how to teach a complex subject in a humorous and thought-provoking manner. You're graded on 3 exams and attendance is not mandatory. He gives a study guide for the exams which helps but they are not graded that easy. Only needed to buy a $12 book but there lots of required readings online
19,4.5,5.0, POSC541,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Absolutely awesome professor- would take him again, for sure! made class interesting every day...i learned SO much in this class...he is the best professor i have ever had!"
20,4.0,4.0, PSC541,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARCUS,KURTZ,"Prob my favorite prof ever! It's not an easy class. Go to it, and listen carefully. He gives the 5 sides of every argument so it's impossible for know his opinion. I learned a lot though, and have used this info in other classes. Also slept through and exam, and he was so sweet about calming me down and letting me make it up.Depends on your interes"
