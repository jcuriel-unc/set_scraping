1,4.0,2.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,"Dr. Spencer is a kind spirit and very accessible and understanding. The only downside to this class is that he can be a very slow grader, and when it comes to grading, it often seems like he doesn't actually read the responses but rather give you a random grade. There is no rubric or comments so if you do poorly you won't know why."
2,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3325H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,Dr. Spencer was a great professor. His lecture presentations were bland but if you took note on the words he was saying and read the textbooks the exams were not bad. Also is an understanding grader. Would take an exam from him again
3,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,I don't agree with many of these reviews. I found the material was really interesting and felt like the class made me a more understanding and self aware person. I think people should be required to learn this type of material. He really cares for his students as evident through his willingness to give them feedback through his workshops.  
4,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,"Good professor but takes forever to grade. Let's you submit things a week early to get feedback. Lectures are good, but slides are confusing if you don't go to class. Good professor if you go to class and don't procrastinate its a great class!"
5,1.0,3.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,"Quite literally one of the worst professors I have ever had. This class was 1.5 hours long when it should've only been 55 minutes. He rambles on about studies without actually providing us with any useful information. He has a kind spirit, but there is no way this man is fit for teaching. He is impressed with his own research more than class. "
6,3.0,5.0, PSYCH3325H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,"The course is graded by four exams and a final research application paper. There is an optional cumulative final that can replace one of the four test grades. The info on the tests are half lecture, half textbook. The lecture slides have very little information on them so your notes are really important and you have to know the studies discussed."
7,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,Dr. Spencer was great. Unfortunately with 2020 he had some family complications come up and had to go off schedule but he was always great at communicating that and was very lenient with grading. Class is very lecture heavy and youre graded by a few things. Overall it was a great class and Id be happy to take a course with him again.
8,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,Sooo many people complain about him but he's honestly such a nice guy and he really does care about your grades. His tests are hard I wont lie but I studied for 2 hours before the test and I never got below a B. I believe he does a fine job fo explaining concepts but you actually have to go to class because his presentations are somewhat bare.
9,1.0,4.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,He does not seem to prepare for lectures and also has taken the whole semester to grade the only three exams taken. Does not respond to emails and if he does it is after many many tries. Lecture slides provide no information and is very scattered and all over the place when explaining concept.
10,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,"He does not care at all about us. If you see that the class is not doing so good, why can't he find a way to help us? He contradicts himself while explaining the lectures, so it is very confusing."
11,4.0,4.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,"This class is not impossible, and it is very interesting and intellectually stimulating. There is no homework, but there are 4 tests that require a lot of studying. It is difficult to take notes, but I recommend recording the lectures and taking notes at your own pace. I left this class with more knowledge and an actual understanding of the concept"
12,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,"I like this professor, attendance isn't mandatory but it is mandatory if you want to do well on exams as your notes are all you have to study. His exams can be tricky and he is a tough grader especially when it comes to the essay portions of his exams, make sure you know this studies he describes and how they connect with the topic of discussion."
13,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,He has passages that should be read prior to each class and I did not read one of them. He goes over them in depth in class and that was enough for me to do very well on the written portion of the exam. The class is hard but there was a google doc full of notes that was helpful for studying. It's an interesting class and his Qs are conceptual.
14,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,"Never been more lost in a class. The studies he teaches are unprofessionally done and don't make sense, so they are very hard to study for. He gives 4 exams and an optional cumulative final to replace your lowest exam but he will not have all of your grades in in time to see if you need to take the final so you pretty much have to take it anyway"
15,2.0,5.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,"This is a 3000 level undergrad course that is formatted like an advanced graduate level class. We can rely only on empirical articles to piece together class concepts. There is no textbook. The slides are minimally helpful, and the professor is hard to reach. If you want a challenge, great. But know what you're signing up for. I sure didn't."
16,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,This professor is horrible. He takes forever to grade exams (like a month). He doesn't email you back and he teaches the class on stupid research that is very difficult to understand. The class is nice but with him teaching it makes a whole lot worse. I think he is a grad professor as well; this is a mid-level undergrad course
17,1.0,4.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,Impossible exams and very unclear notes. takes him over 3 weeks to grade exams and very hard to reach through email. If you take this course- take with a different professor
18,3.0,5.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,"Took Stereotype and Prejudice. There are some basic online notes, so you have to show up to class and pay attention. 4 hard tests and optional cumulative final to replace your lowest exam. This class shouldve been easier but the amount of info was too much and he describes all these studies in a difficult way. Nice guy but hard class."
19,1.0,4.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,SPENCER,Make you read and memorize many junk research articles for exam. Those articles are not very informative and some of these research play around with number and graph makes the result seems significant. Just Awful!
