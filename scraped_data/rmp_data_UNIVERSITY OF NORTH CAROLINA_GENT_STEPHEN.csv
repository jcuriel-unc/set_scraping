1,5.0,3.0, POLI287,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEPHEN,GENT,"I'm not done with the class yet, but if you are considering taking POLI 287 with Professor Gent, I 100% think you should. The material is very straightforward, and Gent actually teaches the material (you aren't left to struggle and learn game theory on your own). Definitely take this class."
2,4.0,3.0, POLI287,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEPHEN,GENT,"Professor Gent is a great political science professor. For someone who had never taken a POLI class before, I found even the more complex material fairly easy to understand when he explained it. The lectures are a little dry, but it's clear he cares about the material and students, and is always willing to give partial credit where it's due."
3,4.0,3.0, POLI287,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEPHEN,GENT,I have really enjoyed Professor Gents class. His lectures are not always super interesting or engaging but they are solid. He is straightforward and a good teacher. He explains game theory well and really wants his students to succeed. A solid choice.
