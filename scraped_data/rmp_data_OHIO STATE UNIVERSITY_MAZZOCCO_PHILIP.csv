1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PHILIP,MAZZOCCO,My favorite professor Ive ever had. All his papers are super clear on what he expects and hes super laid back. He grades pretty harshly but gives a lot of really great feedback. His lectures are really clear and to the point. Hes very lenient on attendance and homework deadlines.
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PHILIP,MAZZOCCO,This is the second class I have had Phil for and he is by far one of the best professors I've had. He's a tough grader but our exams are take home so he should be. He is always willing to help and constantly encourages students to stop by during office hours.
