1,2.5,4.0, PUBHHMP4650,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NAOMI,ADANIYA,"She obviously knows what she is talking about in regards to the class. However, students did not know that much, and she was not super clear in what was expected. Multiple times I got points taken off for things I would have done if I would have been told to do so. Also, attendance ""wasn't mandatory"", but she did random attendance checks."
2,1.5,4.0, PUBHHMP4650,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NAOMI,ADANIYA,"She's clear as mud when it comes to everything--almost as if she is writing her dissertation on academic vagueness. Lectures are not mandatory but she throws in all sorts of attendance checks and participation activities, so you better attend. I was excited for the group project but I was stuck doing all of the work and it really dragged on."
3,2.5,4.0, PUBHHMP4650,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NAOMI,ADANIYA,Very unreasonable and harsh with grading group work. She would basically laugh us off when we went to her for help/clarification. She's absolutely brilliant and dedicated to her studies  but I don't think she understood that her students aren't at the same level of knowledge as she is. She's moving to DC so luckily you probably won't have her.
