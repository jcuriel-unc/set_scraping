1,5.0,1.0, SOC4507,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,NG,Really easy online class
2,1.0,1.0, SOC4507,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,NG,I'm sorry but this is literally the most disorganized class I've ever taken. She had to actually have students request that she post lectures before she did it... she was just gonna let us work through the material with the textbook on our own? Midterm exam was so stupid it wasn't even about sociology it was literally just random facts.
3,4.0,4.0, SOCIOL4507,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,NG,She is a caring person but gives out SO much work. Most of the time the grading criteria is pretty vague but she is a nice grader. Expect to be spending an insanely long amount of time on her classs work
4,3.0,2.0, SOC4507,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,NG,If you are taking a sociology course for the first time I recommend not taking a virtual class from her. She might be better in person but virtually she is so disorganized. Lectures were like 15 minutes long and sometimes just audio with no accompanying slides. If you can navigate a crim/soc classes based on prior knowledge this class will be easy.
5,3.0,1.0, SOC4507,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,NG,"Amy is a great person and very reasonable and her online class was an easy A. There are 3 exams, a few DB's and a powerpoint presentation so the work load is pretty small. However, if you enjoy organization, don't take this class. Amy is extremely disorganized and her lectures tend to be short and confusing. But, I guess the A speaks for itself."
6,4.0,2.0, SOCIOL4507,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,NG,"Really like her as a person, but she can be a little unorganized (probably due to the pandemic) and I had a hard time reaching her outside of class. Sometimes lectures weren't always posted, but the assignments are easy enough to do without really listening to the lectures anyway. Shes really nice and fun though!"
7,5.0,2.0, SOCIOLOGY4507,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,NG,"Literally, she is the best."
8,4.0,2.0, SOC4507,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,NG,"I had her for this course and Prisons & Jails, both really easy classes with clear expectations. 3 exams, small assignments (1-2 pages) and one presentation (powerpoint) of your choice. Easy grader and she's really funny."
9,5.0,1.0, SOC4611,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,NG,Genuinely love her so much. The exams were very easy and she has review sessions and study guides for them. The material is interesting and she makes the class enjoyable. We did a super easy partner project at the end of the semester.
