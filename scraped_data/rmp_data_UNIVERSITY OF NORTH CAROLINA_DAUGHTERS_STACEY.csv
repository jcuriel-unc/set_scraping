1,1.0,5.0, 517,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STACEY,DAUGHTERS,"Horrible and unfit professor. Her grading scale is 1-4. She doesn't grade when she says she will. She expects us to complete our tasks by the deadlines, but takes FOREVER to give our grades back. She would say one day and just not release grades by that day. At least send a class-wide email saying that you will be delayed in releasing grades. "
2,1.0,5.0, 517,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STACEY,DAUGHTERS,Do not take this class! She accused over half of the class of using ChatGTP with no proof. Caused students tons of stress throughout the semester. Never follows through on promises for grades to be released by a certain time.
3,2.0,4.0, 517,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STACEY,DAUGHTERS,"Seems nice, but isn't understanding or accommodating. Unclear instructions with no office hours, SO hard to reach outside of class, so much work over spring break--this class is essentially all busy work. All of the work over the course of the semester piles up at the end with no leniency to move due dates (or to be kind to students asking for it)."
4,2.0,5.0, 517,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STACEY,DAUGHTERS,"No tests, but be prepared for long weekly forum posts, readings, random in-class assignments, and worksheets - all with unclear instructions and graded on a 4 point scale. She is hard to get a hold of, a harsh grader, not receptive to questions, and is judgmental/moody in a way that reflects in her communication with students (passive aggressive!)"
5,1.0,5.0, 517,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STACEY,DAUGHTERS,"Disorganized with deadlines and often forgets to upload class materials or assignments. Very hard to reach by email, and responses are often passive-aggressive. Super unclear grading criteria, very subjective. Lots of busy work and assignments as the course progresses. Graded on a scale of 1-4 for all assignments. "
