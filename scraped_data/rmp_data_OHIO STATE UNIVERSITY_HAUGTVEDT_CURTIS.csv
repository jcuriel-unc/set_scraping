1,2.0,2.0, BUSML4201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"Curtis cares more about what you learn rather than grades. His exams are pretty easy and he is not a tough grader. With that being said, his lectures are not helpful as he gets off topic in every one and he just reads off the slides in his online videos. There's really no way around reading the textbook. He does care about his students tho. "
2,3.0,4.0, BUSML4201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"His lectures are exceptionally pointless, you will still have to watch online lectures, hours of tedtalks, and write discussion posts. Exams are pulled directly from quizlet's so study those. Once i found those I got 100% on every exam. Also have a 15 page paper that just requires effort."
3,2.0,3.0, BUSML4201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"This class consists of the option between weekly discussion posts or a 15 page paper due at the end of the semester, weekly quizzes, and a few exams. Curtis lectures about random things instead of the actual graded material during lectures, while also pushing questionable political narratives within the course material. "
4,5.0,2.0, BUSML4201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,A lot of people who don't like this class are people who like being spoon-fed their education. Haugtvedt is extremely intelligent and chooses to focus on more real life examples in lectures. I learned soft skills of critical thinking and drawing my own conclusions from the text/ news about marketing and CB. Don't take this class for granted!
5,1.0,3.0, MARKETING4232,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"Specifically for branch campus students, he is the absolute worst. He doesnt care about the other campuses at all. Your grade depends one one group project that hell give little feedback for. Its required though, so best of luck"
6,1.0,3.0, BUSML4252,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,He uses class time to discuss anecdotes from his personal life/family/students problems without relating it to course material. The final/only exam is over the book and slides which we don't use except for them being available on carmen. You have to read/study the material on your own in order to learn about public policy or social marketing.
7,5.0,1.0, BUSML4201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,Easiest class ever taken discussion posts but have whole semester to complete Everyone tries really hard on the first few and write novels Wait a few weeks in and people will be writing less Even replies count eightteenpage paper but b s ing works Presentation but you can do it online Exams must watch videos questions worded easy easiest a
8,4.0,2.0, BUSML4201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"Tests are so easy just read over the slides and know definitions from book (only 3 exams). Instead of class on Friday he has ""Internet Friday"" where he posts videos for you to watch. Requires 3 discussion posts a week (don't procrastinate). Only downside is the 18 page paper. Lectures are basically him telling stories about his life. No homework."
9,2.0,2.0, ML4201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,Class is almost entirely based off of Ted talks and his own anecdotes. Interesting guy who obviously cares a lot about consumer behavior but has little actual teaching ability mainly due to the fact that he is constantly cancelling class.
10,5.0,2.0, BUSML4201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"This class includes participation, 45 discussion posts, 3 exams, and an 18-20 page APA style paper. Don't procrastinate on discussion posts, exams almost exclusively cover bolded definitions from the book and class PPTs, and the paper is over a topic of your choice (easy grader). Professor Curtis is a very nice, caring, and knowledgeable teacher."
11,2.0,2.0, BUSML4201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"If you are interested in going through 5 minutes of slides during class & then discussing current events or his/other students personal & often unrelated experiences, take Curts class. It is a cakewalk, but you learn little to nothing about what you're supposed to be learning. 15-20 page paper at the end of the semester he definitely doesnt read"
12,4.0,2.0, BUSML4201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"Not a bad instructor overall.  Nice guy, good lecturer.  Canceled our Friday class so it was just Monday Tuesday each week.  But in its place you have to write 3 discussion posts a week (kinda a lot - gets annoying)  There is a 15 - 20 page paper for the final, but you get to choose the topic so it is not completely terrible."
13,5.0,1.0, BUSML4230,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"Good teacher, learned a lot. He stands up there and talks about advertising in general and doesn't really teach you about the notes. DON'T buy the book. The notes he posts on Carmen are all you really need to study for the two tests. 3 discussion posts per week and Friday videos instead of class plus a 10 page paper that was on an advertising topic"
14,4.5,2.0, 4232,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"No friday class for all his classes. Instead, you'll have internet friday to post discussions. Boring  lecture, just watch videos. Really nice personality!  May get so so  scores on the exam, but your overall grade will look good. "
15,5.0,2.0, 4201,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,Pro. Curt is my mentor at OSU! Had 3 of his classes and all got A. Paper required but page limit is not strict. 8 is fine for a 10-page paper. Pictures are allowed. Reading is preferred for exam. Very approachable. Had a mental break down last semester and he talked with me on the phone for 1 hour!  You can visit his office just to chat. 
16,4.5,3.0, BUSML4232,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,World authority on Consumer Behavior. Very personable and easy to approach.  Concerned for students' understanding of the topic and its impact in the real world.
17,5.0,2.0, BUSML4230,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"Very rarely have I came across a class that was as relevant and meaningful, and goes beyond just book theories like his class. Really  great class to take if you want to learn instead of just memorize useless information to get by."
18,5.0,1.0, MARKETING4232,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"The most ""engaging"" professor I've had at OSU. He actually talks to you, not at you. He piques interest using relevant topics for discussions. The textbook he assigned is incredibly relevant. This isn't a fake postâ€¦ I just loved the class. The tests were easy if you study the terminology from the book. Big paper at the end, but it was fun to write."
19,1.5,3.0, MKT4230,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"I was longing to take this course but he really failed my high expectation. He barely talks about any of the info thats from the textbook which would be on the exam, and spends a lot of time on watching videos in class."
20,5.0,1.0, BUSML4232,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CURTIS,HAUGTVEDT,"Easy as pie class that's actually really interesting. For the exams, Don't bother with the slides (as he never goes over them), just study the definitions in the book and you'll ace the class. Essay paper is a bit long, but really that hard if you know how to write and have a lot of references (which is not hard with online stuff)"
