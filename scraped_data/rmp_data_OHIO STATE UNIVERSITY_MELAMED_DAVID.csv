The online place where homeworks are conducted is so difficult. They would take me three hours sometimes just to get the stupid programming to work! He doesnt give much feedback, but his TAs do. Two good things about him: didnt have to go to class, quick responses."

He made things political that didn't need to be political, especially for the type of class that it is. Just overall, not a good class. 10/10 don't take unless you absolutely HAVE to."

He tries so hard to help his students and is really flexible. He is super knowledgeable about what he does and I respect him a lot. Lectures are kind of boring, but its not that interesting of a class to begin with aahah"
