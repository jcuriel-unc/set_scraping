Always helpful and compassionate, he is the shining star of the Marion campus. He is a genuinely kind professor concerned with teaching in manner that is understandable and relevant. 2220 can seem tough, but the math is simple. Daddis is a can't miss professor."

3,5.0,3.0, PSYCH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,DADDIS,Absolutely LOVE this professor. Always available during office hours and if you have a want to get a good grade and are willing to put in the time he will certainly work with you! Had an issue one semester where I missed over a month of class and he was more than willing to work with me to ensure I was able to pass the class. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
4,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,DADDIS,"He is a great professor and can tell he loves what he does and is more than willing to help you as much as you need. He makes it very hard to fail, if you come to class, ask questions, and do the work he will not let you fail! He is so helpful and is really there to help his students... Pretty much if you fail it is because you don't care! love him"
5,1.5,4.0, STATS,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,DADDIS,"I have this prof in 2 classes, he is not very approachable. In both classes, he runs out of class room as soon as it's over. He says see him after class but you can't, he is gone within a few min of it ending. Notes are confusing, not very organized. Wish he would give us full notes and just made us participate more. Seems like a good guy otherwise"

7,5.0,4.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,DADDIS,Gives you formulas but it is not easy.
8,5.0,1.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,DADDIS,"You'd have to try really hard to NOT get an A in this class, haha. He makes it as easy as he possibly can, and you don't have to memorize any formulas. Very low-stress class."

10,5.0,4.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,DADDIS,Great teacher! He doesn't make things easy for you but when you do have difficulties he is always more than willing to help until you get the concept.
