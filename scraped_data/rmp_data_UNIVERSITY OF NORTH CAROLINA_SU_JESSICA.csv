1,5.0,2.0, SOCI468,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JESSICA,SU,She's super sweet and flexible and the class isn't bad! I found the midterm to be a little more challenging than the final. Didn't get perfect scores on assignments but it was still enough to get an A. The content was very interesting and useful to know. She's also super open to feedback throughout the class which I think is very respectable. 
2,5.0,2.0, SOCI53,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JESSICA,SU,Amazing lectures and class activities! Gives great feedback on assignments that are actually interesting and helpful. Really puts in time and effort to make a good classroom experience. Values everyone's opinions when it comes to discussions. Would totally give a 6/5 if possible. Please put in effort and don't just go for an easy A though.
3,5.0,1.0, SOCI53,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JESSICA,SU,She is one of the best you can find at UNC. Very kind and supportive. Grade is not harsh. Do first year seminar with her. You will be fine. Best experience i have in the 23 spring.
4,4.0,2.0, SOCI53,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JESSICA,SU,Professor Su was great. Her lectures are interesting and makes the class really engaging. The papers are worth a good amount of your grade but the class is pretty easy. 
5,5.0,2.0, SOCI468,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JESSICA,SU,"You can't go wrong taking this class! Dr. Su is extremely nice. Her lectures were very informative and easy to follow, and the material is very relevant and important. No presentations, one semester-long paper, quick class assignments, and relevant and usually quick readings!"
6,5.0,2.0, SOCI468,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JESSICA,SU,"Professor Su was super kind and truly cared about the success of her students. She gave amazing lectures but participation was not mandatory. In class assignments throughout the semester, so attendence required. Super easy work and small reflections every 2 weeks. One big paper throughout the semester, was not too overwhelming. Open note exams."
7,5.0,2.0, SOCI468,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JESSICA,SU,Professor Su is a sweetheart and super understanding. She made this semester better for me. There's a lot of discussion within the class. There was also a big final paper but we worked on it throughout the semester which made it easier. There was only a midterm and final.
8,5.0,2.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JESSICA,SU,"Prof Su is such a sweetheart. Literally one of the kindest people I have met. This class is super interesting and fairly easy. You have 5 assignments, all equally weighted. Attendance isnt mandatory but you will miss the in class activities if you dont show and those are easy points. I never read the book and still got an A. Highly recommend!"
9,5.0,2.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JESSICA,SU,"Dr. Su is so sweet. Doesn't give pop quizzes, just simple assignments in class. Always welcomes participation, great lecturer. Loves to connect with her students. Open to any suggestions to improve her class. Exams are pulled from slides. Assignments are unannounced and count as attendance. No makeups but the lowest 2 are dropped."
10,4.0,1.0, SOCI468,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JESSICA,SU,"Dr. Su is an extremely kind professor (she also has a super cute family). The class was easy enough, although a large portion of our grade depended on a single term-paper. Paying attention isn't nearly as important as studying her study guide and reading the texts. She was generous enough to round my grade up without my even asking!"
