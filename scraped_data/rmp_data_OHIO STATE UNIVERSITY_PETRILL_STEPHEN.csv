1,5.0,2.0, PSY3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,"The BEST professor I have ever had. He is passionate and teaches material very clearly. He is understanding and helpful.10 of 12 reflection discussions are graded and are all pretty easy. Exam questions are pretty much off the slides, but you do have to read assigned articles and study. If you are thinking about taking this class with him, TAKE IT!"
2,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,"I would rate him a 6/5 if I could. Dr. Petrill is a lovely professor who's thorough, yet not overwhelming with the amount of info he goes over in lectures. This is a professor who genuinely cares about his students and their understanding of the material. Definitely one of my favorite professors and classes so far!"
3,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,"3 out of 4 exams are graded and 10 out of 12 discussion posts are graded, and that is it! You will get full points on discussion posts as long as you write it. Exams are not too easy but never too hard, and you can skip final."
4,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,Dr. Petrill was pretty understanding this semester and held optional meetings each week where students could ask questions. The course was your best 10 out of 12 discussion posts and best 3 out of 4 exams. It was pretty easy to get an A in this course and Dr. Petrill was always genuinely kind and caring to his students.
5,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,"Things were different this semester, but Dr. Petrill was great. The class was graded based on exams and dicussion posts. His exams were very fair- if you read the slides and took notes, you'll be fine. Zoom classes were not mandatory, but I'd definitely recommend going. He really cares about his students and is passionate about what he teaches!"
6,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,"Professor Petrill was super helpful and super clear. He wants his students to succeed and it's very easy to get a good grade in the class. He gives out a study guide before the test that tells you exactly what the test is on so if you get a bad grade, it's your own fault. Sometimes there is random participation points."
7,4.0,3.0, PSY3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,The midterms are multiple choice with some short essay questions in the end. He prepares a good study guide that'll help you do really well if you use it.  He takes random participation points during some classes so it pays to show up. We had one 3 page final paper that was doable but took effort. I'd recommend this class and he's a good professor
8,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,Really enjoyed the subject matter and made his students want to learn and enjoy it as well. More conceptual than memorization. Takes random participation points.
9,4.0,3.0, 3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,"Very straightforward class, he seems to care and if you listen in lecture and go over his powerpoint, you should get a B. If you pay attention to detail, then you probably could get an A. Really nice guy, and he's just very down to earth."
10,4.5,3.0, PSYCH3335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,Dr. Petrill is an amazing guy. He has been one of the most caring professors I've encountered at OSU. He genuinely cares for his students and wants their success. I would recommend taking notes using the powerpoints on your laptop. He goes too fast through the slides to write it all. Exams are straight forward from the study guide. Not a hard class
11,5.0,3.0, 3335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,Dr. Petrill was a good professor. He was a good lecturer and was clearly passionate about what he teaches. His exams were tough (mainly the short answer portion). I enjoyed this class!
12,5.0,3.0, 3335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,"Professor Petrill's PowerPoints are presented well, his lectures are engaging and he encourages class discussion. Stephen seems to genuinely care about his students, makes himself available for questions, and is clear about his requirements for the course. Although attendance is not mandatory, his passionate attitude makes you want to be there."
13,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,"Professor Petrill is a really great professor.  He's really helpful and genuinely wants his students to succeed, learn AND enjoy the class.  I highly recommend him"
14,4.5,5.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEPHEN,PETRILL,"The class was definitely a challenge, but Professor Petrill was kind and always willing to help out students."
