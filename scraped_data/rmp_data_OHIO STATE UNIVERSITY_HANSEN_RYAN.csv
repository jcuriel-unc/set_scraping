1,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,one of the easiest classes ive ever  taken . Professor ryan was super understanding and sweet gave extensions on assignments. Easy class does require a textbook as long as you read the textbooks youll do fine in the class
2,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"Ryan was a good professor and a nice person.  He was very considerate about work and flexible with deadlines.  He would go off topic somewhat frequently in his lectures. This class was very easy if you went to class and took decent notes.  For the ""exams,"" I recommend just skimming the textbook and looking at the notes you have taken."
3,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,Interesting and easy class. Professor is a great guy!
4,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,Easiest college class I've ever taken. Highly recommend. I will admit that it may be due to my strong neuroscience background and the fact that I've been in therapy for years. 
5,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,Very easy going and very understanding. Lectures were goodish although the exams leaned towards the harder side and being open note didnt make much of a difference. very nice about extensions and looking back at low grades and changing them.  no attendance grade and uploads video lectures online. very very nice guy
6,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"Dr Hansen is so sweet. love him. I did not go to his lectures a lot and ended with over a 100 in the class. Some assignments took a little too long, but the assignments were interesting. As long as you do the work you will do great and learn a lot"
7,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"Bro easiest A I have ever got. Literally so many options to get extra credit. My grade is over a 100%. I ended up not doing his last 2 assignments cause I would still be at an A. I took this in the summer, in the 2nd session. The class goes by fast but if you stay on top of things you should be good. If you email him, he will give you extra time"
8,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"Professor Hansen was really interesting, but there was a ton of reading in the course, like a ton. He had us submit our notes for that reading, so there is no getting out of it. It is a good class though. I wish there had been areas touched on more in depth, but its an intro psych course so I can't expect that much. He allowed it to feel personal."
9,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"Dr. Hansen is extremely caring and understands that we are humans, not everything goes our way. At the end of the semester, he gave everyone two weeks to turn in anything they may have missed. Also, there are 14 ""exams"" which consist of roughly 20 questions. If you do the assigned readings, these will be easy A exams. Great class overall!!"
10,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"Dr. Hansen is the most caring professor I have had while in college. At the end of the semester, he gave two weeks to turn in anything that you may have missed. I do have to say, there was a ton of reading, but was worth it when the ""exams"" were easy. The exams are after each chapter, no more than twenty questions."
11,4.0,1.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"Dr. Hansen is willing to help students. There are a lot of readings which take a huge amount of time but that is definitely necessary to learn psychology. A quiz every single class but it ensures that you would read. Exams are not hard, and there are extra credits."
12,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,There are daily top-hat quizzes for attendance but he is very understanding and will let you take them if you miss class. Read the assigned reading before class and you will ace the tophats. He is so kind and understanding and genuinely cares about you and has a passion for teaching. tests are open book and online and are easy if you read.
13,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"This was his first semester teaching this class so it was kinda disorganized, but still very easy A. He had all the exams take home, open note, online so that was nice. Honestly learned more from the book than class, but he does easy reading quizzes every class so you have to show up."
14,3.5,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"AU14: Lectures can be helpful but if you read the textbook it is basically the same thing. I read the text for every chapter which was time consuming but made everything easier. Lectures not mandatory, hes a nice guy, grades things easily, tests are department tests, no quizzes or homework. Tests are hard so you better make time to read."
15,4.5,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,Very enthusiastic about psychology and really engages the audience. I took his online class and he posted videos of all his lectures and the powerpoints he used. He could not have been more clear of what was expected from the students.
16,5.0,2.0, 1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"Ryan is amazing! He knows what he is talking about, is absolutely willing to give extra help, and makes sure everything that he says is clear as day. I would definitely take him again if he offered another psych class. Love him!"
17,5.0,1.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"Loved this course and this instructor! Material was easy and instructor is extremely helpful when you have any questions. Midterms are straightforward- as long as you read the text and study the material, you'll be fine! :)"
18,5.0,1.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"Dr. Hansen is a nice guy. Really dedicated to his students and their learning. Lays class out clearly, easy to contact. Tests are very straightforward. Study your online lecture notes and you can do well. There are flashcards on studyblue which are pretty helpful if you don't have time to make them. Study hard, stay on top of things and it's easy."
19,5.0,1.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,"Very friendly and easy to contact. His job and his students are his #1 priority. He made video lectures for his online students and gave us tons of helpful resources to study. Without discipline to study, the class can be hard because there is a lot of information. Be warned that you need extra time out of class to do the REP credits."
20,5.0,3.0, 1101PSYCH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,HANSEN,He was the nicest prof I have had. He genuinely cared about the subject and the class. He gave many extra credit opportunities and always pushed back due dates!
