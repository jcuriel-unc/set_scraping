1,4.0,1.0, PSYCH2311,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Mark is a very good professor and really cares about what he does. He is not the best with technology, so taking his class online was not my favorite, but if you can take his class in person I would definitely do that! He loves talking to the students which is fun. A lot of group work, a quiz biweekly, 2 papers.. overall easy A"
2,4.0,1.0, PSYCH4522,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"This class was online and he was very relaxed about it, we even met his cats. Sometimes he forgot to post his lectures for the quizzes, but if you sent him a reminder he would have them up by the end of the day. All the material covered on the quizzes is on the PowerPoint. There are weekly group homeworks that take about 30 minutes to complete."
3,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Dr. Polifroni is awesome. No textbook for the class, so almost all of your learning is done through his lectures, which was nice. Group HW assignments almost every week, but they were pretty easy, and so were the quizzes and DB posts, and there weren't that many of them. Two papers that were also simple and straightforward. Strongly recommend him!"
4,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4515,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"This dude is awesome. This is my second class with him and he did not disappoint. This isnt an easy course (none of his courses are), but if you put in a little effort, its not a problem. He wants everyone to form their own opinions and ideas about the course material!"
5,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Dr. Mike is such a great and inspirational lecturer to have. Hes super helpful and understanding, and challenges you to think for yourself. The class was heavy in terms of coursework (it was over six weeks) but very manageable. If you do the readings and attend the lectures then youll learn a great deal from this class and earn an easy A."
6,4.0,3.0, PSYCH2311,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Dr. Polifroni is an incredibly sweet professor who truly cares about his students success, and is clearly loved by a lot of students. Unfortunately, I found his lecture slides to be dry and confusing to follow, which made studying for exams a bit difficult for me. Aside from the exams, he's a pretty easy grader on papers and discussion boards."
7,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2311,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,I really enjoyed Mark's class. His lectures are very straightforward and the exam questions are taken straight from his powerpoints/lectures. I felt like his explanations during class were very helpful so I recommend going to class. Not too work outside of class either. I recommend Mark!
8,4.0,3.0, PSYCH4522,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Mark cares about his students and knows what hes talking about. He listens to feedback from the students to help us out. He gave us 3 extra points from unfair test questions, as well as 5 easy points EC (if one other person in your group did it, he gave it to all of you). Not mandatory, but going to class is needed to get in class activity points."
9,1.0,4.0, PSYCH4522,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"He was a good professor. Only ""was""! He changed the syllabus before the final exam. Even he did not send any message about that. The syllabus change increased the percentage of exams from 73% to 80%!! That caused many students to gain lower grades... A terrible professor..."
10,4.0,1.0, PSYCH3335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Mark's class was super easy, 4 quizzes and 2 papers. I enjoyed the material we went over and Mark clearly really cares about his students. Lectures and grading were super laid back and it was a very easy A. Occasionally had in class assignments but I still did fine missing a few days. Would highly recommend taking any of Mark's classes!"
11,3.0,4.0, PSY4515,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Emotion psych is not about emotions rather people who study them - disappointing. Lectures are unorganized, he goes off on tangents. The content is easy but the lack of organization makes things hard. The guy really likes philosophy which is annoying for a 4 level science class. If the class had more psych in the psych class it would be better."
12,5.0,4.0, PSYCH4515,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"He is the most hilarious professor I've had; I always laughed during his lectures. He is great at taking dense material and giving relatable examples that are easy to remember. He can sometimes read through slides too quickly, and he tends to get political at times. All in all, I would definitely take another class with Dr. Mark."
13,4.0,2.0, PSYCH4485,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Easy class with 4 exams, an easy paper, and 3 discussion posts. Attendance isn't mandatory and all notes are posted online. He is a great guy who is really funny as long as you don't mind his clearly liberal views! Highly recommend."
14,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2311,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Mark is my favorite professor I've had at OSU so far. He is funny, thoughtful, and overall a great teacher. I would highly recommend taking any class with him because he is very passionate about the subject. The class is a bit hard... study for the exams! The content is taken DIRECTLY from the lecture slides nearly verbatim."
15,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4485,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Dr. Polifroni has easily been my favorite professor so far at OSU! Even though attendance isn't mandatory, I never miss his class because he makes lectures so interesting. The exams aren't bad, there are three midterms and a final. As long as you study the lecture slides you can get an A."
16,2.0,2.0, PSYCH450,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Professor Polifroni is a very nice dude and cares about his students, and his class is easy. Sadly, lecture slides are very unorganized, and he goes off on political tangents every day that rarely have anything to do with the content (and if they do, they are forced connections). It almost seems like he uses class to get out his political anger"
17,4.0,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"His lectures are so engaging; he often references his own research. There were two research papers in the class, one of which was challenging to read but he is not a difficult grader. Final is not cumulative, just memorize the slides for each exam so you dont have to buy the textbook. This class was an easy A as long as you memorized the info."
18,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4485,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Dr. Polifroni is amazing. He's one of the only professors I've had who is truly open-minded and respectful of all students, even if someone disagrees with something he said. His lectures are unbelievably interesting, funny and he's a great storyteller! He's also easily approachable and I can tell he truly cares for all his students, which is rare."
19,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4485,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,I cannot rave enough about Professor Polifroni. Best teacher I have had in my 4 years at OSU. He just gets it. He is so clear about his expectations and his exam questions are taken straight from lecture notes. Also super easy to reach if you do not understand something. Definitely take him especially if you are a psych student!
20,5.0,2.0, PSY3335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,POLIFRONI,"Mark is a great, funny professor to have and his class was enjoyable to have for my final semester! I hated missing class because I enjoyed the material & his teaching of it. The material is very comparable to Intro to Psych, with a little bit of Abnormal Psych maybe. Not a challenging class, and made easier by Mark's explanations."
