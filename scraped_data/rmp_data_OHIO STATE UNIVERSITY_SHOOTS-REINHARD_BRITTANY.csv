1,2.0,2.0, 3325,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"This class was pretty easy- minimal effort put in and got an A. However, this professor is terrible. Her lectures are a joke and her assignments are stupid. Her grading is so odd- it almost seems like she takes off points sometimes to just make it look like she actually reads and grades them. If you want to learn, don't take this class."
2,5.0,1.0, IS4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,I took psych 3325 and she was amazing. Group assignment and homework/quizzes. 
3,5.0,1.0, PSYCH4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,one of the smartest and best professors at OSU!!!!
4,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"Class was required for my major but very interesting and easy to stay engaged, gave lots of real world examples to make topics clear, if you ever have a question, email her and she'll respond right away"
5,3.5,3.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"She's a very nice person and a pretty good lecturer that tries to make pretty boring material interesting, but her exams were overly hard. Even though I had pretty much every term from her slides memorized, I still struggled on some of her exams because she asked very nit-picky questions that forced you to know many intricate details."
6,5.0,3.0, PSY2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"Dr. Shoots-Reinhard is by far my favorite professor that I have had. She is extremely funny, smart and honestly cares about the students and will go out of her way to help. When it comes to her lectures she is extremely enthusiastic, and can really relate the content to your life and the real world. I recommend signing up for one of her courses."
7,4.5,2.0, PSY1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"She really cares that her students do well in the class and gives many opportunities to bring up your grade. Participation matters but she gives more than enough opportunities to earn all the points. She usually tries to end class early, and reviews after every section. She drops 6/11 quizzes and 2/3 written assignments. I would take it again "
8,3.0,2.0, PSYCH4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"Overall, a good professor and an easy class. Class was mandatory for my major, but Professor Shoots-Reinhard made the lectures enjoyable. The quizzes were sort of tricky, but easy tests and easily graded paper. An obvious and admitted liberal with a bit of a teaching bias, but it's not hard to get past. She is very endearing and very funny."
9,4.5,1.0, IS4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD," She is one of the best professors I've had. She cares about the subject, cares about the students, and loves to share personal stories. As much as people have complained about her tangents, they are relating to the subject matter and will help you learn and retain the material. I've had two classes with her & will be taking another next semester!"
10,3.0,4.0, PSYCH4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"She'd be a better professor if she lectured on subjects covered in our quizzes. As others have pointed out, it's about 55 minutes of her telling the class about her day. Reading can be interesting, but it's very long. She is at the least upbeat, and genuinely interested in the subject. "
11,5.0,3.0, PSY1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"Super nice professor who works to make sure that you learn what you'll use in your career.  Is readily available to help students who need it and works to get to know students, which is uncommon at large universities like OSU. "
12,2.0,1.0, PSYCH4522,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"Be prepared to be bored. You're spending tuition on her basically telling the class to tell personal stories as opposed to actually teaching anything (about 20-30 minutes of every 55 minute class is personal stories).   On the rare instances that she is teaching, it's dry, and ridiculously boring.  Easiest A ever when I stopped going to class"
13,4.5,1.0, PSYCH4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"Brittany likes to facilitate class conversation which can get a little boring, but her exams are easy (you can contribute questions to them and she has buffer questions), and participation points can be made up by posting on the forum.  Going to class isn't strictly necessary because she posts slides, but I enjoy it for her helpful examples."
14,3.0,3.0, PSYCH4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"Participation points are the only reason to attend. Not really a surprise but she's an obvious liberal to anyone over 21, but most college kids dig that, so understandable. Other than that, really dry lectures, tries too hard to fit in with the students. I wasn't a fan. Easy pass though. As far as security goes, they should have someone else teach."
15,5.0,2.0, PSY2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"She is really funny, makes assignments and tests pretty easy if you memorize the notes. The examples she uses in her slides are on the exams. Great professor"
16,4.0,5.0, PSYCH367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,She is a really funny person. I had a lot of fun in this class. It was interesting and she made the class atmosphere laid back and comfortable.
17,3.5,4.0, PSYCH367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"Brittany is a funny and friendly person. The problem with this class is that there are many sections of it so the instructors have to be strict on certain things like late papers and such. There's lots of note-taking, and the tests are pretty hard, but not so bad if you prepare yourself."
18,1.5,5.0, PSYCH367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRITTANY,SHOOTS-REINHARD,"Brittany made psych 367 very difficult. She made ready exactly off her power points and made class very boring. There was no benefit in going to class besides getting participation points. For the exams she never gave out review sheets and told us to know ""everything"". She graded the papers and test like it was a graduate course. No fun, no help!"
