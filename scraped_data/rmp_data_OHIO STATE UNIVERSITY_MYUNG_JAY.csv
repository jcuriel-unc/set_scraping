1,1.0,3.0, 5612,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"If you're taking 5612 as an elective for CSE, find something else. Class is run abysmally and his lecture slides are the worst I've seen at OSU by far. His lectures are damn near impossible to follow, as he goes on tangents about his conferences or his college life. He's a nice guy, but don't take his class if you actually want to learn something. "
2,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"Tough but fair, one of my best professors yet! You will not regret taking his class, but you should regret not taking the time to learn the material. Ignore reviews on his accent, he is well spoken. He is fair and upfront about the grading scale, but it is tough. I found he is the best instructor of PSYCH3312. Also READ READ READ, the book is good!"
3,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"People either love or hate Dr. Myung. He is incredibly passionate about the material he teaches, so he tends to touch on all the developing topics he's excited about, even if they aren't related to class material. If you love the material you're learning, you will definitely enjoy his classes; if you're going since it's required, then likely not."
4,1.0,1.0, PSYCH5612,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"Myung is a terrible prof, please don't take him. He covers a wide range of material at a superficial level so it's hard to know exactly what you need to know. He told us in class today NOT to study for our first exam because he needs some way to differentiate our grades - everyone does well on the essays and he needs some people to fall behind."
5,5.0,5.0, PSYCH5618,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"He gave lots of extra credit and easy going. No attendance. HOWEVER, this course is NOT EASY AT ALL! Though it's a psychology course, it almost all about neural networks. For passing this, you must know programming (use MATLAB), multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and more. HE IS THE ONLY CHOICE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS COURSE. So, be prepared."
6,3.0,4.0, PSYCH5618,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,Only teaches concepts in class and says only basic math is required. You need to know calculus. If you don't already know how to code you'll struggle. We all struggled through the homework. Luckily there were a few knowledgeable people in the class. He did give relaxed grades on some of the homework and projects though.
7,5.0,2.0, PSYCH5612,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"He is an amazing person. Really nice and understanding. He cares for all of his students, and encourages people to visit him outside of class to talk about their interests. His lectures, however, were monotone and it was easy to fall asleep through. Thankfully, he is very clear with what he expects the students to know on both exams and papers."
8,2.5,4.0, 5612,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"His accent isn't the worst that I've heard, but there are still a fair amount of times that you have to think about what he said. Seems like he cares more about the history and people involved in the topics discussed than the material itself. Also he is more interested in talking about his work and what conferences he's attending than teaching. "
9,2.0,4.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"Be sure to look at your exam after it's graded because many of the ""correct"" answers don't make sense. You should challenge them. Will ask about dates of research and other useless trivia on exams. Helps to take statistics class prior this one. Lectures weren't that exciting but you must attend or there's no chance you'll pass the exam!"
10,1.0,5.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"I spent more time trying to understand what he was saying than actually learning anything.  I hated this class more than any class I've ever taken in three years of college.  He was TERRIBLE and I don't know if he could have made the material any more boring.  TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FROM THIS PROFESSOR!!!!!!"
11,1.0,5.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,He is the worst teacher ever. He just talks at you and doesn't really make sense while he does it. The tests are super hard and he weights them really heavily. Multiple choice questions worth 6 points each!WTF?! Don't take this class with him!
12,1.0,5.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,This is the worst professor I have ever had!  He has the most boring lectures (very thick accent and monotonous voice) ever but you have to go to get the notes.  His exams are hard and before our first exam he said that if he said something that didn't agree with the book to go with what he said!  Overall the worst professor I've ever had!
13,2.0,4.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"This guy is terrible! Not only are his lectures incredibly boring, but he also contradicts himself constantly. I went to all of the lectures, but he posts the lecture notes on Carmen, so you'd do fine w/o going to class. The midterms were harder than the final. Terrible professor. Avoid Jay Myung if at all possible!"
14,3.0,2.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,The most boring class I have every taken. He has no speaking variation. I think I went 5 times all quarter and atill got a B
15,1.0,4.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"He is not very nice or helpful. He speaks English but has a hard time with pronouncing words. His homeworks are easy but his lectures are boring. For our class, right before the exam he changed the chapters that would be covered by adding another one."
16,1.0,5.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,To sum him up as a teacher he was horrible. He was incoherent in lecture and in his tests. The tests were extremely tricky. Hopefully I don't come across any more bad teachers like him.
17,1.0,5.0, PSYCH612,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"I think he may be the worst prof I've had at Ohio State.  Horrible at explaining things, not at all willing to help, and his accent is so hard to understand that I spend more time trying to figure out what he said than actually learning the material."
18,4.0,3.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"This class is manditory, so I would suggest keeping up with your math.  The grading is pretty strict but otherwise he's a cool guy.  You'll receive extra points for questions that ""spark"" the intellect, and that he likes.  He'll help you out if necessary.  Don't feel shy to visit him at office hours."
19,1.0,4.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"not helpful, terrible teacher"
20,5.0,5.0, PSYCH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAY,MYUNG,"Despite his accent he is able to communicate the material thoroughly, speaks better english than most native speakers. Learnt a great deal in his class  as he encourages and spends time explaining things if you come halfway. Is very rigorous and knowledgeable but not inflexible, I have had him as an advisor so I know. I recomend meeting him halfway"
