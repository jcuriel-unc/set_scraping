1,2.0,4.0, PLCY340H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"I wanted to love this class. Unreasonable readings. PPTs (not posted) have more flair than substance. The random musical outbursts were endearing until they quickly weren't. He lectures in this dramatic, rehearsed voice and at times it seems like he's more interested in putting on a performance than making sure students understand the content. "
2,5.0,2.0, PLCY340H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"Everyone should take a class with Meier. He's passionate about the subject, and does a good job of explaining what the real world implications of ethical frameworks are. This class is great for anyone who wants to engage with public policy. For the people complaining about the difficulty or readings, maybe the honors section wasn't the best choice."
3,5.0,4.0, PLCY340H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"Professor Meier is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. I couldn't recommend him more. His teaching style is a bit unconventional (frequently sings during class), but it makes the class memorable. He does assign a ton of reading, but it is almost always interesting and topical. He is by far the most passionate teacher I have ever had at UNC."
4,2.0,3.0, PLCY340H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"I was excited to take the honors section of this course as I was told it would be a seminar style, debate-heavy class. Meier teaches 340 as if its a performance with a script and complex slides for each class that focus more on aesthetics than content. We rarely engage in extended full class discussions which he subjugates to the forum. "
5,2.0,4.0, PLCY340H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,I took this class to fulfill a gen ed and to get an honors credit. This ended up being the hardest class I took (I think I'll finish with a B or B+) and the class I spent the most time on. There is a crazy amount of reading and the grading criteria for essays and writing assignments is extremely vague. Would not recommend (unless ur a plcy major)
6,5.0,3.0, PLCY565,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"TAKE A CLASS WITH MEIER!!! He does assign a lot of reading, but quizzes are short and readings can be skimmed for main points. His lectures are so entertaining and he really cares about his students. "
7,5.0,4.0, PLCY76H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"While he does make you work for it, Professor Meier is an incredibly passionate lecturer who does his best to make sure his students know he cares. There is a lot of reading to be done, and he expects active discussion, but the class is a lot of fun, and you really feel like you get a lot out of it."
8,5.0,3.0, PLCY76H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"Really enjoyed this class- you definitely get back what you put into it. Prof Meier cares so much and is truly passionate about his subject (literally was Zooming in from Geneva if needed). Definitely some reading, nothing unmanageable, but don't expect to do no homework just because it's a fys. Would recommend!"
9,4.0,4.0, PLCY76H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,This class will be difficult and you may struggle but not without wonderful themes and a caring professor. My knowledge on global health policy is limited but you do have a few takeaways from the class. Less guided thinking and more on your own. Overall I liked the time I spent and it was worth it and I might just know how to save the world.
10,3.0,4.0, PLCY76H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"The problem is how vague it is. Although he is fun will dance in the class, talks in different voices, themes, and plays music. No grading criteria and no specificity when it comes to expectations. In some cases, he does expect you to know more about Public Policy than what we do know especially since this is an FYS. Just be prepared. Okay class."
11,3.0,4.0, PLCY565,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"He cares about the material & helping students, but class was stressful, participation is absolutely mandatory (and he'll make you feel bad if you don't), the participation ?s sometimes don't relate to the day's readings, there are 4-5 long readings per class with daily quizzes, & no grading criteria for the papers worth 15-30% of your grade."
12,5.0,4.0, PLCY565,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"Amazing class with an amazing professor. In light of the class being held online, Professor Meier was accommodating and provided very engaging lectures and assignments. While the readings were a bit dense, Meier provided a lot of opportunities during office hours or other times to discuss the class topics in greater detail. Would highly recommend!"
13,3.0,5.0, PLCY340H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"Hardest class I've ever taken. Meier is an amazing human who cares about his students, but his exams are unnecessarily hard and assigns hours upon hours of dense philosophy readings every day. Could never work on any of my other classes it was so much. Tough grader, expect to work your butt off with little reward. Screwed my mental health."
14,5.0,4.0, PLCY570,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"I looked forward to attending this class each day. I was new to global health and found the textbook to be comprehensive, insightful and thought-provoking. The lectures then enriched lessons from the text through class discussions, case studies, and informative PPTs. Make it a priority to take a class with Professor Meier!! He's truly inspiring."
15,5.0,3.0, PLCY76H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"I went into this FYS without much knowledge about public health and absolutely loved it! Professor Meier does a great job of making it enjoyable and memorable. There is quite a bit of reading (3 readings assigned per class), but overall very manageable workload. To anyone considering him and/or PLCY76H, 10/10 would recommend!!"
16,4.0,3.0, PLCY76H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"Meier is definitely an expert & super passionate about global health. Every class has a theme (Hamilton, Star Wars, etc) which makes it more fun. We had readings & a (pretty easy) reading quiz before each class, & 2 papers + a final paper. Participation is key (20% of grade). I did learn a lot & people interested in health should take this class!"
17,5.0,4.0, PLCY565,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"Dr. Meier is an amazing professor. He is the only prof I am looking forward to taking another class with. Professors can have their own political opinion, this is not high school--life is political, people need to face that reality. He is always open for conversation & if you have differing opinions, voice them instead of writing online."
18,1.0,3.0, PLCY340H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"Meier might not directly lecture opinion but he makes it very clear which side he thinks is right and chooses to only present certain information on a topic. Theres nothing wrong with professors being liberal, but there is something wrong with being unable to disagree with them"
19,5.0,3.0, PLCY340H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"One of my favorite professors I've had at UNC, Meier truly cares about his students and it's very clear that he is teaching in order to help create a better future. He is inspiring and has incredible experience and wisdom in human rights. Lectures are o entertaining and musical. While you can tell he is left leaning, he doesn't lecture opinion"
20,5.0,4.0, PLCY570,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BENJAMIN,MEIER,"Dr. Meier is the most inspirational professor I have ever had. I left his class inspired to work and change the world. This class is very difficult and has a lot of readings, but all of the work felt worthwhile and necessary. His jokes and Hamilton references are hilarious and he is always kind and caring in office hours."
