1,4.0,2.0, NCSI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"Lots of busy work but very doable. Daily quizzes, polls, group project, and 3 write ups. 3 midterms were 10% each and final was 20%. If you get 100s in all the non-test categories and do all the extra credit, you only need to average an 85 on the exams to end with an A. Also Dr. Penton really grew on me throughout the semester. Overall, good intro!"
2,1.0,5.0, NSCI221,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,She never gets to course content in class. So much time is spent doing irrelevant group work. The readings are dense and she does not go over them so you have to teach yourself everything in order to know whats going on. The exams are hard and do not reflect class material at all. She does not value students time.
3,4.0,1.0, NCSI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,Dr. Penton is a passionate professor. Her class was interesting and has extremely similar/converging course content to BIOL 455 & Biopsyc. Tests are online and low-stress because of this. There are easy reading quizzes and group projects as well with opportunities for extra credit. 
4,4.0,3.0, NCSI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"Dr. Penton is a good professor who works to make engaging lectures, but I found the overall course structure to be a bit disorganized. It was difficult to determine what you actually needed to know for tests. The class is not a traditional 'top down' approach- rather we often covered more specific information before knowing the high-level info."
5,4.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"She's pretty funny. I didn't like her TAs all that much but that's not really her fault. Overall a pretty average professor, but that's good because there wasn't really much to complain about. The textbook is awful because there's not a lot of useful information in like 2 long pages of reading, it's like trying to find needles in a hay stack."
6,1.0,3.0, NSCI221,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"Even if the class was hard, I've had pretty good experiences with other STEM professors at UNC. But with Dr. Penton, she is extremely disorganized and has a ""my way or the highway"" mindset when working in groups. I feel like I have not learned anything in the class and she is not very considerate toward her students."
7,5.0,3.0, NSCI221,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"The material is not easy, but if you are passionate about molecular neuroscience then you will love this course. Dr. Penton is a wonderful professor who cares about the well-being of her students. While the tests are hard, there are a lot of other assignments that act as a grade buffer. Expect weekly group work + daily hw quizzes"
8,2.0,3.0, NSCI221,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,Professor Penton is a nice woman but she is extremely disorganized and that is reflected in the course content and lectures. She puts a huge emphasis on group projects that are a huge waste of time and do not help you learn. You will need to teach yourself outside of class to pass the exams. Would not recommend. 
9,2.0,4.0, NSCI221,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"NSCI 221 is unique. Heavy emphasis on group work, including weekend assignments in groups. Dr. Penton would often not finish the slides for the day, and I found the slides didn't prepare me well for tests and quizzes. Dr. Penton does clearly care about the material, but I found the course design did not help me learn well. "
10,2.0,4.0, NSCI221,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,I was very disappointed with this class. Dr. Penton would never finish any of her slides in class even though they were extremely rushed through. She also wasn't the nicest to her students. I thought the CREATE Method was a huge waste of time because of how much of the material we didn't get to learn in class. Overall just would not recommend her!
11,3.0,3.0, PSYC390,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"Rachel is pretty nice, her tests are pretty hard but they are super buffered by other grades so it is not the end of your grade if you don't do well on them. There are a TON of assignments which blows, but it is groupwork so get a good group and you will be fine. "
12,4.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,LOTS of busy work but entirely online/asynch. A lot of the busy/group work is really pointless to the learning process but good in terms of grades because the exams were pretty hard and application based (covered a lot of material too). There's a lot of extra credit too. I think you can get at least 10 pts EC throughout the semester.
13,5.0,2.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"Dr. Penton was super understanding the entire semester. She had a 24 hour grace period for every assignment, even quizzes so we could take them late. She also dropped the lowest 6 quizzes. This class was entirely online but you could complete the lessons asynchronously if you wanted. Lots of extra credit opportunities which boosted my grade."
14,4.0,4.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"Dr. Penton is a great lecturer for this class, even if it was all online. She'll give you video lectures and in-person ones so that you can afford to miss a lecture or two. You have to read a fair amount and the exam questions are rather difficult, but if you study and put the time into it, you'll be fine. Focus on learning targets."
15,3.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"This class is a lot of work, which is comprised of quizzes, writing assignments, class engagement, concept maps, dense readings, group projects, and exams. The grade was 45% on graded components throughout the semester and 55% were exams. This class was not enjoyable online as it was not engaging in this setting, but she is nice and tries her best."
16,3.0,4.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"Our class was held over zoom, but the Sakai page was made for a fully virtual class so attendance was not mandatory. I will say, you will have no idea what's going on. She is very clearly a researcher at heart and overcomplicated most of the simple topics. To make up for this though, there is lots of extra credit and slack built in if you try. "
17,1.0,5.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"She played her video lectures in class, paused to expand on a part a bit, and then continued to play it. Then, her lectures would expand into homework with readings and quizzes due before every class. She also has multiple group assignments which people tend to not shows up. Teach yourself type class. Exams are difficult for no reason (2nd)."
18,3.0,4.0, NCSI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"Dr. Penton is a nice professor, but she is not my favorite. The class is lecture-heavy, but her explanations are confusing. She also loves group work, which nobody really participates in. Her tests can be difficult, especially since you will probably have to teach yourself most of the content. "
19,5.0,4.0, NSCI320,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"Dr. Penton is my favorite professor at UNC and is super caring. Specifically, this class is insanely group project-oriented, so if that's not your thing skip this. Break out rooms for at least half the class and we all know nobody learns anything from that. But if this was in person maybe it would be better."
20,3.0,5.0, PSYC175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,RACHEL,PENTON,"Dr. Penton seems like a very nice person, and she's built in a lot of flexibility to the course. That being said, the workload is absoultely crushing. You basically have to teach yourself, and every 'lesson' is approximately 5 hours of work, all turned in for a grade. I understand that it's an online course, but theres essentially no interaction."
