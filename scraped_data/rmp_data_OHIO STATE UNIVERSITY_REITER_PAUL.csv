1,5.0,3.0, PUBHHBP7520,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,REITER,"Dr. Reiter is one of the BEST professors and faculty at OSU! He is very professional, caring, and willing to help students pass his course(s). His teaching style and compassion for students makes attending OSU worthwhile. He certainly had a positive impact on my graduate school experience. I highly recommend him! Dr. Reiter rocks!"
2,5.0,2.0, PUBHHBP7520,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,REITER,"Dr. Reiter has a ton of cool experience he brings to the course. I think for some the material could be dry, but he made it so interesting. I found his lectures so useful, interesting, clear, and concises that I sent them to my former health research coworkers. This was the most useful course of my MPH so far, & his expertise is critical to that."
3,4.0,3.0, PUBHHBP7520,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,REITER,"Dr. Reiter was great. This class was my second time having him and while he is a little monotoned, his lectures show that he a professional in his field. I learned a lot from him, and I will say that is very receptive to any and all feedback whether it be content from lectures or how the class is structured!"

5,5.0,2.0, 3140H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,REITER,this class was super interesting and I really enjoyed it! Easy A if you do the work!!! I would say I spent an average of 30 min per week on this class and got an A. The actual class sessions are super easy and lowkey. Paul is very kind and understanding and knowledgeable in his field. Guest lectures are usually very good as well. Class can be long
6,5.0,3.0, PUBHLTH3410H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,REITER,"Dr. Reiter makes this class so much fun! If you don't have an interest in PubH, don't take it. There's a paper every week, 3 short answer questions every other week, and one 3-hour presentation (not as bad as it sounds). If you do the work and put in effort, you'll get the A. But it's a lot of work"
