1,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,PITT,"Dr. Pitt is a good professor and he did a great job on teaching the lecture. There are only 4 exams matter for the final grade, and if you dont want to take the final exam you can submit an essay instead. He also provides about 5% extra credit. The exam is hard, but if you study for it before then you will have a good grade."
2,3.0,4.0, PSYCH302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,PITT,This class is hard mostly because of all the information in the lectures. Studying is extremely difficult because he gives virtually no information about what is actually going to be on the exam so you end up spending a whole day going through hundreds of slides for a 32 question exam. He is very helpful answering questions during lectures tho
3,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,PITT,"Mark is very knowledgable. However, I found his class to be pretty difficult. The lectures were boring and the material is very dry (especially at 8am). His exams are pretty tough since they are only 30 questions, he gives you no study guide or help with studying, and there is a lot of material covered (especially for the cumulative final)."
4,3.0,4.0, PSY3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,PITT,"I struggled with this class probably more than any other class in college (I'm in my fourth year). Overall, PLEASE don't take it at 8am like I did. No homework is required, it is only there to boost your grade - everything is based on test scores. Attendance is not mandatory but it's very hard to keep up without it. The material was very dry to me."
5,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,PITT,Pretty easy class! Exams and discussion posts only. As long as you study you should be fine! A lot of material but pretty straight forward and reviews it often. No book needed and powerpoints online. Knows a lot and would take again!
6,5.0,2.0, PSYCH302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARK,PITT,"Good prof. Very clear and his powerpoints are easy to follow. Don't have to go to class, just study powerpoints and you'll be fine for the two midterms and final. If you do go to class, don't be afraid to ask questions. He's extremely knowledgable and knows how to answers questions in a clear and interesting manner. Highly recommended."
