1,5.0,3.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"Not sure why Dr. Hopfinger has such a low rating tbh. Super understanding during a crazy term(FA21). Straightforward material. Available after class for questions, encourages discussion in lecture. Only con is he doesn't post lecture slides before class + u cant watch recorded lectures w/out an excuse. Lecture is fast but engaging. Def type notes!!"
2,4.0,4.0, PSYC230H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"Don't get too discouraged by the reviewers! He's not bad, but you definitely do have to work for your grade. If he tells you to read something specific in the textbook, read it! Exams are very content/lecture heavy, readings heavy (but only what he specifies so it's not too bad), so give yourself some time ahead to prepare. He speaks fast too."
3,1.0,3.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"Exams are a bit tough, professor is not lenient or funny."
4,3.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"Hopfinger is definitely more of a researcher than a professor. His class is super dense and the information can be confusing at times. He lectures fast and asks very specific questions on exams based on minute details of lectures. You definitely have to put in the work but he's not the worst, he means well and tries to be entertaining."
5,3.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"I did not do so great on the first exam but once I started putting in the work my grades have definitely improved. You have to attend class and don't even bother trying to write out your notes because he talks very fast. Be prepared to remember lots of material. Not the easiest class, but he is helpful, and I found it interesting at least!"
6,2.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"Ok, so... don't take this class with him. Lectures using a powerpoint and says so much while also saying nothing at all while speaking very quickly. 70% of final grade is based on 3 exams that comprise of details he mentioned while lecturing, but aren't in the powerpoint, so you either take really good notes or you fail. Not worth it."
7,2.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"VERY lecture heavy, goes very fast in class. instructions are rarely clear. 3 exams throughout the semester that make up 300 of your 400 possible points. two 5 page papers on very boring articles."
8,3.0,4.0, NSCI434,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"He moves quickly through lectures, doesn't post them, and 90% of exam material came from those lectures. Perfectly nice guy that is open to help at office hours, but this class certainly is one of the harder courses I've taken in the psyc major."
9,3.0,4.0, NSCI434,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,This class is super lecture heavy and he lectures for almost the entire period without stopping. He doesn't post the slides so get ready to type really fast. Tests are hard and have both MC and short response and are worth a lot of your grade. The class isn't too much work on a day to day basis but you really need to prepare for exams.
10,2.0,5.0, NSCI434,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,Very nice person but tough in grading. I won't suggest taking NSCI 434 with him.
11,2.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"Hopfinger was a perfectly nice professor, but lectures moved too quickly to comprehend what was being said. Textbook readings did not line up with lectures and powerpoints were not posted online, which made studying difficult. Exam grades did not reflect my understanding. Though not the hardest class I've taken, I would not recommend this class."
12,3.0,4.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"Hopfinger is a great person with an obvious passion for cognitive psychology, however, his refusal to post power points online and his material dense lectures make this course strenuous. Additionally, you'll only have a total of 400 achievable points in a semester, so study hard for tests."
13,2.0,4.0, PSYC89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"I took his first year seminar class thinking it was going to be extremely interesting. Wrong. The FYS on Brain Plasticity was basically a book club. There are 2 required books that you have to purchase and read. You have to write a 3 big ideas and 1 thought ""paper"" on essentially every chapter in the books. There are also long scientific ""articles"""
14,1.0,5.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,Never worked so hard to get such bad grades in a psychology class
15,2.5,5.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"Powerpoint lectures are not available online. The TAs are really tough graders (and the only ones who actually grade your material). Dr. Hopfinger goes way too fast during lecture, and for some people, it's very difficult to meet with a professor after class to look at certain slides."
16,5.0,2.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,"Dr. Hopfinger is a good lecturer, though at times he goes too fast for those who take notes by hand. All his powerpoints are online and he makes an effort to engage his students. We had five 2-page papers that were hell; few people got full points on them. A few voicethreads and discussion days for participation. B's are very common, A's are rare."
17,5.0,2.0, PSYC230,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JOSEPH,HOPFINGER,Good lecturer. Definitely there to help you. Fairly easy class. Several 1 page research review papers. A presentation. A midterm and a non-cumulative final. He's somewhat boring but a very nice guy.
