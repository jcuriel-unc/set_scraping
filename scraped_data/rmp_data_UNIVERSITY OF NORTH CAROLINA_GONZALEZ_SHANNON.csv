1,4.0,2.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHANNON,GONZALEZ,"There was a lot of reading for the class. The class was a lot of effort, considering its a 100 lvl course. The exams were based off the lectures, so take good notes and study those notes. Usually all multiple choice, around 40-50 questions. 4 exams. If you study the lectures you should be able to get A or B."
2,5.0,2.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHANNON,GONZALEZ,Such a great professor! I was actually interested in the material we learned and she was genuinely passionate about what she was teaching. Easy class to take for a gen-ed. I highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Malone Gonzalez!
3,4.0,2.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHANNON,GONZALEZ,The class is very interesting and is super easy if you've ever taken a sociology class before. There's a good amount of homework with the readings but I didn't do any of the readings and got Bs on the midterms and full credit on all homework and in-class activities. You can def half-a this class and get a good grade.
4,4.0,2.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHANNON,GONZALEZ,"Shannon was great, super sweet and provided a lot of extra credit for exams. The exams themselves were crazy easy, I didn't do a single reading, just looked at the slides before exams and came out with an A. Great soci class to knock out that gen ed. "
5,5.0,3.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHANNON,GONZALEZ,Pretty easy class for the most part. Study a little for the exams and you will do okay.
6,5.0,2.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHANNON,GONZALEZ,"Such an interesting and thought provoking class! There are many assignments that are based on your own experiences and analyzing your own life, which makes the course much more relatable. There's many readings, but she goes over them in class and they're generally interesting. Take her class is you can!!"
7,5.0,3.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHANNON,GONZALEZ,Professor Malone Gonzalez has been by far the best professor Ive had at UNC. There are readings to do before every class but shes very real and open to what she expects out of every student and truly wants every student to succeed in her class. She has an awesome personality and its truly a great lecturer. Exams were also pretty easy.
8,5.0,2.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHANNON,GONZALEZ,"Prof Gonzalez is really caring and actually has a personality- unlike many professors. There are only a couple exams and homeworks that make up your grade, however she is super accommodating and wants students to get A's. Definitely recommend!"
9,5.0,1.0, SOCI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHANNON,GONZALEZ,"This class was very interactive, we spent a lot of time in discussion groups. Gonzales was very understanding, she made our tests open note in order to combat the stress students were feeling. This class was interesting but it did not focus on what I thought it would, we talked a lot about race, sexuality, and how all these things interact."
