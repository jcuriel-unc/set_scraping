1,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"Dr. Rudy is an amazing professor! Her class is discussion and activity based so be sure to make friends in the class. She has clear expectations of her students and really make sure that the material we learn in class can be applied in real world setting!! Overall, definitely recommend!!"
2,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"I am surprised at all of the not so great reviews here. I absolutely loved Dr. Rudy! Her lectures are very interactive and discussion based, answers all questions. I recommend asking questions and talking because it really helped me to learn the information. Gives a lot of extra credit opportunities and quizzes are simple if you go to class."
3,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"Really great class. Discussion based class, with two readings & response papers a week. The readings were always really interesting and the way she led discussion sparked a lot of inspiration. Taking her again next semester and really looking forward to it."
4,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"Dr. Rudy is my favorite professor at OSU. Her lectures are much more discussion based, which some people may not like, but I really enjoyed it. Im going to be taking my third class with her next semester. Shes so caring and definitely prioritizes the well-being of her students. I have nothing but good things to say about her class!"
5,1.0,2.0, PSYCH4555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"She was not helpful at all, and was often rude to students. Lecture was mandatory (unfortunately) but class work was fairly easy. The weekly reading assignments were very annoying at first, but you were luckily able to work ahead in the class. Overall, I dont recommend, I learned basically nothing."
6,4.0,2.0, PSYCH4555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"I really enjoyed her class, but I will say that if you're planning on skipping a lot (like me), you will lose quite a few participation points. There were weekly journal articles, but they weren't super hard and didn't take a lot of time. Class discussions were always interesting and she definitely makes it an open space for lots of opinions."
7,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"I really liked Professor Rudys class and looked forward to going every week. The material was interesting, and she taught in a way that made lectures enjoyable. This is the second class of hers Ive taken, and I am going to take a third because I think shes one of the best professors Ive had!"
8,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"I had to end up dropping this class and replaced it with abnormal psych. She does not share PowerPoints, and goes way too fast. Extremely boring and quizzes are very difficult. All the quizzes and exams are online except the final. Textbook does not correlate with lecture. Pop up assignments given at the end of lecture and due before you leave."
9,1.0,3.0, PSYCH4555,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,I heard such good things about Dr. Rudy but I hated her class. She made it very clear from the beginning of the semester that her convenience is more important than us. She didn't want to make homework more accessible because it would be annoying for her to grade. She has also been extremely rude at times and let full-on fights break out in class.
10,3.0,3.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,not too bad. never get behind on the lectures. youll regret it when its exam time guys ..
11,3.0,5.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,she was an alright professor but you definitely have to take notes and go through the textbook. you wont pass without at least doing that because her questions u cant look up and are usually directly from the her lectures or textbook. she doesnt give a lot of homework at all but its important to do good on quizzes and tests.
12,2.0,3.0, PSY3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"I wasn't a huge fan of Dr. Rudy. She tended to go off topic in the beginning of class (the first 15 minutes) and then towards the end of her lecture time, she would rush through the slides because she didn't have enough time. Slides were never posted either. I felt uncomfortable asking her questions bc of how she talked to students."
13,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"Dr Rudy makes her classes interesting and entertaining, and I looked forward to it despite it being an 8 am. She has specific criteria for her classes, and expects you to follow them, but truly cares about the students she teaches and is very fun to talk to when you have questions. I loved her personality and her teaching style. Plus no tests!"
14,4.0,4.0, PSYCH3340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"Slides arent posted online. Exams are applying knowledge Not just memorizing. One project, 3 midterms and 1 cumulative final. Got a better grade because of extra credit so do it!"
15,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"Lots of presentations and projects, but no exams! She's an amazing lecturer and you can tell she really wants to help us. Attendance is definitely a must though or you won't do well. She's a pretty generous grader and is generally very understanding. Worth noting: she handled the COVID-19 situation amazingly and was very clear & open about changes."
16,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,Shes definitely one of the best lecturers Ive ever had. She makes you really want to engage with the material and it is insanely easy to get an A. Youll hate her if youre the type to not show up to class since its mostly designed around participation and in-class work. Ive taken other courses she teaches and I very strong recommend them too.
17,3.0,3.0, PSYCH3340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"I did not enjoy Dr. Rudy's teaching style, she had group work for such a large lecture class and wasted a lot of time doing so. Rushed through a lot of slides and didn't post slides online. One midterm and one cumulative final, though they both were only worth 12.5% of the grade. Only reason I got an A was the crazy amount of extra credit she gave."
18,5.0,3.0, 3331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"Dr. Rudy is a great professor! You learn a lot in her class, much more than most of the other classes I've taken in the psychology department. She's understanding and tries to explain things in a way that everyone will get them"
19,2.0,2.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"Her class is easy, but pretty annoying. She's not very clear on some of the project criteria and not willing to work with you if you miss ONE class. There are pop quizzes over readings and a project. She also doesn't post her lecture slides online, which makes studying for the midterm and final a little intense. its hard to know what to focus on."
20,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LESLIE,RUDY,"Dr. Rudy is awesome! There are no exams in this class, so everything is based off of attendance and projects. They're really straightforward and if you just follow her instructions, you'll be fine. I learned a lot in this class and will retain way more of it than if I had just been memorizing definitions for a Scantron. Take her class!"
