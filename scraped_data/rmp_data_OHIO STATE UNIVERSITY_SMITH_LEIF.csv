1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"Amazing class and professor who had some great stories from his own experiences. He made the class fun and engaging. Attendance matters as he takes it randomly throughout the semester, but I had a great time so never skipped."
2,4.0,3.0, PSYCH2420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"Leif himself is great! The class is very interesting. Class consisted of 9 quizzes, 4 attendance grades, and group project. He takes attendance at random so make sure you show up to class. The quizzes were short (5 questions) but they left no room for error. Great class if you're a good test taker, but don't take to boost your grade."
3,5.0,3.0, PSY2420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"Leif makes class enjoyable. He has some challenging quizzes, but as long as you study the material and take notes during lecture you should be able to keep a manageable grade. "
4,4.0,5.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"W/ Leif ATTENDANCE MATTTERS. 5 quizzes (scheduled), 5 attendace & 5 reflections (both not scheduled & taken in class. in my class in the last 4 weeks, which was annoying), & final only 200 points total (not weighted.) He promises hella extra points but only offered like 5 points. He has cool stories from clinical experience. show up & you'll pass."
5,4.0,5.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"w/ Leif, ATTENDANCE MATTERS. I didnt like Leif's class because lack points (nothing is weighted). 200 points in total, 5 quizzes, 5 attendance and reflections (separate things primarily taken in the last 4 weeks of the semester), and the final. Everything is cumulative. With that said, if you attend and pay attention, you'll pass also cool stories."
6,3.0,3.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"Leif was not my favorite professor. he was entertaining at first, but he began to repeat his stories a lot and let students get off topic. Lectures took longer than they needed to. Not graded on many things (5 attendance, 5 reflections, 5 quizzes, and a final). quizzes were 10 mcq, but were cumulative and some were a bit challenging."
7,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"For such an early class, it was the one I never wanted to skip. His lectures were always equally as entertaining as they were informational. His experience in the field and his advice were helpful to anyone considering becoming a psychologist. However, his quizzes are a little difficult so make sure you study! Attendance is also SUPER important!!"
8,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"If you do decide to take his class, make sure you show up for every class because he makes attendance basically 50% of your grade. There's no debating your missed attendance situation unless it's severe enough to warrant a doctor's note. "
9,1.0,4.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"Super harsh grader with no feedback. I would expect that if he wants us to be creative, he would be as well. Instead, he made us regurgitate the information in a ""new"" way for most of the assignments which was not helpful to learn the material. However, I did not watch one lecture and still got an A-, so do the discussion posts."
10,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"Dr. Smith is a fun understanding professor. Just be upfront with what is going on in your life and he will work around you. Showing up for class is 50% of your grade, so make sure to go."
11,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"Dr. Smith is the best lecturer I've ever had at Ohio State. His lectures are so interesting and I could listen to him talk forever. However, he gives 6 cumulative exams (not counting the final) throughout the semester, so be ready to study a lot! The questions can also be a little tricky. But overall, Dr. Smith's humor and wisdom make up for it."
12,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"The real life stories were the most helpful. Dr. Smith is the best instructor I've ever had. The people who don't show up and don't complete the work will not do well, but that's on them."
13,1.0,3.0, PSYCH2420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"Took this class because I had open credit and I thought it would be an easy A. 9 quizzes make up a majority of the grade in the class, but every quiz is cumulative, so you pretty much take a 5-question final exam every week or two. The only other points in the class are from attendance and a group project, so you have to do well on the quizzes"
14,5.0,1.0, PSYCH2420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"Love this teacher. Kind of hot in my opinion. haha, anyways, he's a really great instructor. Lectures are pretty interesting, and he's not the type that has to go to the last minute. When he's done with the powerpoint slides, he's done with class. Gives great advice for school, and life in general. Also, explains his past experiences, which are fun"
15,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,"Dr. Smith keeps his lectures funny & fresh. He is very easily accessible via email, text, or Carmen and is willing to help students at reasonable request. It's important to show up to class because he will randomly hand out an in-class activity for EC. Show up, pay attention, take notes, review lecture slides & you'll pass with a stellar grade."
16,5.0,3.0, PSY2420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,Dr Smith is the best instructor/professor I have ever had in my whole life. He inspires me to be better. His examples help make learning easy and fun. Please take his classes and you won't regret it.
17,5.0,3.0, PSY2420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,The best!
18,4.0,3.0, PSY2420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,Dr. Smith is an amazing professor. He uses personal examples to make us understand. I would recommend him to everyone. Best professor I have ever had!
19,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,One of the best professors I have ever had. Super passionate about what he teaches and he cares about his students achieving the best grade they can.
20,5.0,1.0, PSY2420,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LEIF,SMITH,Leif is actually one of the best teachers I have had at OSU so far. He is extremely clear with what he expects and wants you to be prepared for exams (he has awesome review sheets and a review day). He does not want to trick you and what you see is what you get- study the powerpoint and you'll do great!!
