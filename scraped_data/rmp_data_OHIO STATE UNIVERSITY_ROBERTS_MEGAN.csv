2,4.0,3.0, PH3510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MEGAN,ROBERTS,"The class was a positive experience, but could get dry sometimes. She read pretty much directly off the slides, but attendance was a must because we would have surprise in-class assignments which counted as an attendance grade. Grading criteria for her assignments could have been a bit clearer, but she was friendly and responsive to emails."
