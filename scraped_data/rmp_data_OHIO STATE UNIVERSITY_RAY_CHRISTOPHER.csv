1,2.0,4.0, POLITCSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"For being a three credit hour course, he takes it a little too far. Nobody had any idea what would actually be on exam and exam questions were not clearly mentioned on study guide. It was kind of a hopefully I retained this information that he said once during this lecture type deal. "
2,3.0,4.0, PLSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"Professor Ray is passionate about foreign policy but at times comes off as very pretentious during his lectures. He is also a pretty harsh grader, especially with the two memo assignments. There are weekly reading quizzes which aren't bad as long as you read. Some classes will be really interesting and other will be boring, kinda hit or miss. "
3,5.0,3.0, POLS2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,Ray is a very good lecturer that really tried to make sure you understand the world of international relations and american foreign policy. Very engaging and can be surprisingly funny. His papers are rather difficult however and there is quite a bit of reading and quizzes to do. Does offer Extra Credit. Would highly reccomend
4,3.0,4.0, POLITCSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"Memos had no guideline and were harshly graded. Lectures could be good but slightly pretentious. Reading quizzes went up day of. Final/midterm were mix of multiple choice and short responses. Course content at times veered away from foreign policy. Would not take again, which is very rare for me."
5,2.0,4.0, POLITSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"He only rolls out quizzes 1-2 hours before class starts and those quizzes are due 5 minutes before class starts, because apparently he thinks this is your own only class. The memo assignment is designed for you to fail, he is a very harsh grader on this assignment. The readings are very hard to understand and also boring."
6,3.0,4.0, POLITSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,He has readings before every class that were accompanied by difficult reading quizzes. He never sent out rubrics so the papers we had to write were difficult and he is a harsh grader. Worst of all he missed a day of class and got rid of our exam review day in order to go over a pointless lecture at the end of the semester.
7,5.0,3.0, PLSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"Prof. Ray is extremely passionate about the subject matter AND about his students. Yes, he expects a lot, but there is no way to do badly in his class as long as you genuinely try, go to office hours, and show him that you're improving. He's SO understanding of mental health/personal life stuff and is really helpful if you just ask! He's funny too."
8,5.0,3.0, PLSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,Attendance is semi-mandatory. He grades toughly but is clear is what his expectations are. Reading quizzes are easy and a good way to pad out your grade. Interesting lectures and clearly knows what he is talking about. Readings are not overwhelming.
9,5.0,3.0, POLITSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"I loved taking his class in Spring 22. He clearly knows his stuff, he actually cares about his students, he makes his lectures interesting/entertaining, and his assignments are worthwhile. The more you participate, the more you get out of his class. His grades are a little tough, but fair. Plenty of xtra credit opportunities. Take a class with him"
10,4.0,4.0, POLITCSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"Very good intro to foreign policy class- definitely geared towards people with a passion or interest in the subject. His teaching really makes you think about decision making, and you have to push yourself to do well- not an easy class due to the expansive amount of content. Class is mainly reading quizzes, a paper and 2 exams."
11,5.0,3.0, POLITSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,Best professor at OSU so far. Truly valuable of class even if you do not have much to do with foreign policy. So much to learn from him and his lectures.
12,5.0,3.0, POLITSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"I suffer from general anxiety, and he is probably the most cooperative professor I've ever met when it comes to the matter. He shows a true passion for his subject matter and sharing it with his students"
13,5.0,4.0, POLITSCI2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"Ray is just an absolute gem of a person. He is so thoughtful, caring and accommodating. I love who he is as a person, despite him being an insanely tough grader. The real issue here is the content. This class is incredibly difficult. There are mountains of readings, slides, and terms that even open note quizzes and tests can't prepare you for."
14,3.0,3.0, POLISCI2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"Foreign policy isn't my strong suit so I knew this class would be a challenge. Takes a good amount of engagement with the material to succeed. Lectures can be dense, note-taking has to be a strong suit. Good prof who cares about his students, just wasn't the most interesting class I've taken. Like foreign policy? Take this. If not, be prepared"
15,4.0,3.0, POLITSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"I was honestly not expecting this course to be as valuable as it was. Not only does Professor Ray give you a great base in terms of foreign policy, he teaches you a lot of important skills in terms of writing, formulating your argument, and more. The lectures can definitely be a lot, but its a super rewarding and you truly learn a lot."
16,5.0,3.0, POLITSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"One of my favorite professors at OSU. There is a lot of reading, and he is a rather tough grader, but he is also very helpful with feedback. I would say only take this course if you're actually interested in foreign policy. The man is a great lecturer, and if you care about this stuff, you're going to get a lot out of this class."
17,5.0,4.0, POLITSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"Professor Ray is one of the best instructors I have had so far throughout my college career. He is a very tough grader but it made me think significantly more about the content of the class, as opposed to someone who just gave completion credit or graded with minimal effort. He obviously cares about his students' lives in and out of the classroom."
18,4.0,4.0, POLITSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"Professor Ray is an amazing lecturer and gives great feedback. Some people have been saying that he comes off as arrogant or condescending, but I did not get that impression at all. He just expects a lot from his students and encourages them to think through difficult concepts. The class is very reading-heavy and attending the lectures is crucial."
19,5.0,4.0, POLITISCI2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"Go to office hours! He is a professor who will respect/help you more if you show him you care about your grade and his class. Don't hesitate to ask for help before memos/midterm/finals. Really knowledgeable and cares about foreign policy issues today. History heavy. For poly sci majors, this class will be a great foundation for future classes."
20,5.0,4.0, POLITSC2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CHRISTOPHER,RAY,"He's very passionate and clearly knowledgeable about what he teaches and expects you to thoroughly engage with the content. Hes very understanding too. Most grades are from reading quizzes and a couple papers throughout. Shouldn't take this class unless youre genuinely interested in foreign policy, but if you are and you care youll love it."
