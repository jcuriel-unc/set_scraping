1,3.0,3.0, PSYCH4532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"This class should be a requirement for all psych major. The articles analyzed and discussed are eye-opening and definitely changed my perspective on the field of psychology. If you find the science component lacking from other psych class, take this class as we go over empirical evidences and why it matters. Lectures can be dull though."
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"If you are wanting to pursue graduate school/ phD / PsyD in clinical psych, take this course! I found the material to be absolutely fascinating. Looks at a lot of research, identifies key problems in the growing field of clin psych, prepares you for furthering your education. A good amount of reading, but never just ""busy work"". Smart and nice prof"
3,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"Dr. Vasey's class prepared me for grad school, and he's a wealth of knowledge on clinical psych. There's much to do for the weekly readings, but they're opportunities to practice critical thinking/research literacy skills rather than busywork. Lectures could be hard to follow, but worth going to if you're interested in clinical psych topics/issues."
4,2.0,4.0, PSYCH4532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,Do not take his class if you're a full time student and have limited time to study. His class is very boring and he's a very though grader. in order to do good in his class you need to consume a lot of time preparing every week. He gives pop-quizzes. I do not recommend taking this class while taking other hard courses. He's very boring.
5,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"You definitely need the textbook to do well on the quizzes (4, worth 10% of grade) and some of the exams have book based questions. The exams have a ton of free response essays but he's a very fair grader, it's just a bit tedious. If you're going into the psych profession at all you neeeed this class."
6,3.5,2.0, PSYCH4532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"Essential if you are considering on becoming a Clinical Psychologist, he teaches you how to critically evaluate research, most of the material is about logic. Rarely used the textbook (just rent it from the library for the assigned readings). Had 5 quizzes at the end of the semester from assigned papers (not textbook). Exams have like 6 essay :("
7,3.5,3.0, 4532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,Brilliant professor... and provided a completely new perspective on psychology that I would've never had unless I took this class.  Very beneficial because the field is turning to evidence based practice and he's obviously a strong supporter of it.  Personally don't think you should graduate with a psych degree without taking his class
8,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"A very interesting class. If you like clinical psychology, this class is essential. It's mostly about evaluating clinical research, ethics, and policy, not a basic continuation of abnormal psychology 3331. If you like research and clinical psychology, you should definitely take this class. It helped me develop research reading skills too."
9,4.5,3.0, PSYCH532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,Went to office hours and got a lot of help. One of the few psych professors that made me feel like I actually learned something. After his class I feel remotely competent in the field of psychology which is something I've not felt before because most courses cover the same studies with the same dry memorization approach.
10,5.0,5.0, PSY532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"I loved this class!  All essays, long and hard but if you attend class, you will be fine and you will have the choice to not take the final. Which I think was the best news ever! The material is very interesting and he makes the class so much fun. He is very funny. Take this class, you will love it."
11,5.0,4.0, PSYCH532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"Great class from a great profesor. Should be required of all psych majors, simply because Dr. Vasey delves into important issues in psychology that you'll never hear from your advisors. He helped me in & out of class to better decide what I really want to do in psychology and where I should go for grad school. Hard tests, but class is worth it."
12,3.0,5.0, PSY532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,The exams are hard and all essay questions. But he is very helpful.
13,5.0,4.0, PSYCH532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"Dr. Vasey is an incredible professor. You will feel so much more prepared to make decisions regarding psych and your future plans after taking this class. He is also very genuine in wanting to help his students learn and make good decisions in their careers. Understanding, intelligent, and entertaining, you can't go wrong with this prof!"
14,5.0,3.0, PSYCH532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"TAKE THIS CLASS!! Should be required for ALL psych majors! Dr. Vasey is incredibly informative and helpful. The subject material is interesting and sometimes even astonishing. Attend class, because most of the material on the tests comes from lecture. Tests are all essay, but if you attend lecture and do readings and they should be fine!"
15,3.5,2.0, PSYCH532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"Dr. V is the BEST professor at OSU. He is fun, witty, interesting. You will walk away from this class satisfied. No textbook, but daily article readings (not that hard). Exams are a bit lengthy, but just know your stuff and you will do fine. Lecture attendance is mandatory, he goes over what he wants you to know for exams. TAKE THIS CLASS!"
16,5.0,2.0, PESUDOVSCLIN,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"I love Dr. Vasey, awesome class, have to take it if you are a psych major, he is my honors advisor, and I could not have asked for better..!!!!!!! :)"
17,5.0,1.0, 594,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GRADUATE AS A PSYCH DEGREE
18,5.0,4.0, PSYCH532,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"Really cares about what he is teaching.  Tests were all essay, but everything on it was discussed in detail during class, the format makes sure you have a working knowledge of the material, and the grading was very fair. A little bit of effort goes a long way in this class.  Overall a great class."
19,5.0,4.0, PSYCH594,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"Loved the class, loved his critiques, but the tests are in essay format and really difficult (and I love essays!). The TA we had graded all of the exams, and  for some reason, was a total nazi about it. We were allowed to justify our answers to get more credit, but we had to go in to argue with her."
20,5.0,5.0, PSYCH332,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,VASEY,"Great class, I learned a lot. He really makes you think critically ! A nice guy too."
