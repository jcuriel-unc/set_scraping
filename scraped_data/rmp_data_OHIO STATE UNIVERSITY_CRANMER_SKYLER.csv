1,5.0,4.0, 3310H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SKYLER,CRANMER,One of my favorite classes and professors. The class was small and became pretty close over the course of the semester. Dr. Cranmer is a expert in his field and teaches the class well. He's always available and willing to help in any manner. The class was challenging but the projects were useful including intelligence estimates. Take the class.

Skyler used a mixture of discussion style lectures and academic games to keep the day to day interesting. Skyler is very knowledgeable and clearly cares about the topic."
3,5.0,4.0, 3310H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SKYLER,CRANMER,"Great professor. Skyler is highly respected in his field, and his intelligence shines through in class. Classes were split between reading discussions and war games. Papers and projects arent an easy A, but Skyler is always willing to give feedback and offer help before due dates."
