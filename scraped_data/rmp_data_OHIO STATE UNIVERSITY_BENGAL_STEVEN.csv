1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4520,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"Group work is terrible, but Dr. Bengal makes it bearable! This class was very challenging, but Dr. Bengal was there to support us every step of the way. He gives wonderful feedback, and his great sense of humor helps numb the pain when that feedback is negative. He's quite literally an award-winning instructor, so take his classes!"
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"I'm writing this to those of you who attend the first day of class and think, ""Wow, this guy sounds so annoying."" I thought the same thing on the first day, but I was quickly humbled. Steven is the funniest professor I've had at OSU and he can thoroughly relate the content to the students. He actually teaches and I felt prepared for every exam."
3,5.0,4.0, PSYCH4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"Absolutely loved Steven Bengal as a professor. Literally, the best professor I've ever had hands down. His exams can be vigorous but his class is an absolute must-take, a professor I will never forget. "
4,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"Dr. Bengal is one of the best professors I have had at OSU. Funny, engaging, and eccentric. Cheat sheets for exams, but make sure you go to class and pay moderate attention because the slides are not self-explanatory. "
5,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"He's an eccentric and funny guy with excellent music taste. Initially, I was intimidated and scared for my wellbeing in this class, but because he's very good at explaining and teaching, I ended up doing very well. He also gives good feedback if you meet with him during office hours. "
6,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,Super interesting and eccentric guy. His voice is really funny to listen to. Explains the materials very clearly and tries to answer questions all the time. Even though data analysis seems like a dull class he actually makes it a lot more engaging. Would recommend taking any of his classes.
7,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2462,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"I really enjoyed this class, and though I may not have always understood the material, Dr. Bengal was more than willing to help with any questions I had. He may talk incredibly fast but I guess he's just excited about the material. Also, he might be a stand up comedian in his spare time (need confirmation on this)"
8,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2462,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"11/10 My favorite professor EVER. I hate college, but looked forward to his class every day. He wants students to succeed, actually learn, and treats you like a colleague. His assignments were fun to do (I know, it sounds like a reach,) exams are fair (plus cheat sheet!,) and lectures are top tier. TAKE HIS CLASS TAKE HIS CLASS TAKE HIS CLASS!!!"
9,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,Literally the best professor I've ever had. He's super funny and it's easy to get an A in the class if you do the homework and pay a moderate amount of attention. Couldn't recommend him more.
10,5.0,1.0, PSYC3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"A very funny professor who always asks us to ""bombard"" him with questions and is very quick to respond to emails. He provides full and short lectures on each chapter and puts an emphasis on individual exploration. We had a weekly quiz, discussion posts, questions, journal entry/ activity, and a quiz make-up activity with no exams or tests. "
11,5.0,4.0, PSYC3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"professor bengal is soo funny and makes sure that he is available for students whenever they need. it's very clear that he genuinely cares about teaching and his students. the course load is heavy and confusing at times but very interesting. if you're confused about something, he provides great explanations and will clear things up. def recommend"
12,4.0,3.0, PSYCH2462,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"Super funny guy. Lectures aren't mandatory but are never boring - I would recommend attending but he posts abbreviated recorded lectures that are super helpful as well. His tests can be a bit difficult, though - it's sometimes hard to tell exactly what you need to know versus what is extra information. Regardless, he's wildly entertaining."
13,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2462,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"I love Doctor Bengal. He is kind but also extremely hilarious in his classes. His mixture of self-deprecation as well as his beautifully crafted power points make him my favorite professor I have had yet. Though the lectures are not attendance-mandatory, you don't want to miss them (especially for his random tangents)."
14,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"For Halloween, he dressed up as Steve from Blue's Clues and all of us collectively spent the lecture trying to figure out if he was in costume or not, because it wasn't far from how he dresses daily.

11/10 would attend a lecture of his about paint drying."
15,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3325,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"I don't do rate my professors, but he deserves an awesome rating. The funniest professor and one who cares about his students. He's always asking us for questions and when we ask them he is so happy to answer them. I hope he stays as a professor for a long time because he can make learning fun. "
16,3.0,5.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"Dr. Bengal is funny & relatable, but I did not like his course, he's unprofessional and swears a lot, and although the tests are relatively easy, the format rubbed me the wrong way. Plus, when I took his class, I missed a thing or a religious holiday, and he wouldn't let me make it up. That assignment was the difference between an A- and B+ for me."
17,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4525,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"Dr. Bengal is an amazing professor!! I took another one of his course in AU 2021 and I absolutely loved it. Dr. Bengal is amazing at lecturing and he has a way of making sure that you remember the material being taught. Although the exams can be challenging, he is always open to help during his office hours. Definitely recommend!!"
18,5.0,4.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"Professor Bengal is a very swell guy. I would say lectures are mandatory if you want to have success in this class, especially if you do not have a background in data. I did not know much going in, but I feel pretty confident moving forward because of this course. It's not easy material but I feel lucky I had Dr Bengal to help."
19,5.0,4.0, PSYC3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,"This was by far my favorite class this semester. Dr. Bengal is super engaged in the teaching material, funny and has high standards for students. Homework, projects and exams were challenging but fair, and I learned a lot from them (they did not feel like mindless busy work). 100% recommend this class and Dr. Bengal."
20,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BENGAL,Dr. Bengal is extremely knowledgeable in the topics he teaches and is very generous with extra credit opportunities. The course itself is test heavy (4 exams) but his are not cumulative and they're over less than 5 subjects each. Bengal is very enthusiastic and encourages students to ask questions to make sure they understand the material!
