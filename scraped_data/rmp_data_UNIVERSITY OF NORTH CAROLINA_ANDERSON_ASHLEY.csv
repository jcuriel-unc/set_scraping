1,3.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"It is not difficult to get an A in this class if you put in the effort. I got a B+ because I didn't put in any effort into this class. If you do the all of the readings, it'll be easy. It's just a lot. Two papers, weekly quizzes, and recitation participation/attendance is a big part. She also uses UNC check-in for all lectures."
2,4.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"It is not too difficult to get an A in this class.  The quizzes are hard, but the lowest 2 are dropped and the papers/exams are not bad.  There are 100+ pages of reading per week, but I didn't read any past spring brk and still got an A.  Manageable if you commit time.  Anderson is nice and tries to make lecture interesting.  Take Ranko as your TA!"
3,4.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"Notot a ton of homework but there are two 5-7 page papers, a midterm, and a final. These assignments seem very difficult at face value but it is quite easy to get a good grade. Class felt a little formulaic but other then that it was good. It was my first and probably my only poli-sci class I will ever take. Subject material is a bit uninspired. "
4,4.0,2.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"Anderson is an engaging lecturer and is passionate and knowledgeable about her subject. The attendance policy was generous, and so was the grading. Exam preparation was time consuming because there were so many terms to study and only four on the exam, but the exams themselves were manageable. Overall, I learned a lot and would recommend Anderson!"
5,4.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"Multiple readings every week, but I never read them and ended with a B+. Tons of terms you need to know for exams because the exams are free responses, but I studied like a day before and did fine. TAs grade everything so your grade really just depends on if you get an easy one or not. Weekly quizzes, lowest two grades get dropped. Takes attendence"
6,4.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"Solid class. Never did readings but studied hard for exams. Probably shouldve gotten an A, but got lazy on second paper. Exams are graded kinda weird but overall the grading was fair. Class made me consider poli sci as a major"
7,5.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"I loved Professor Anderson's lectures. She is very knowledgable in the content and has a likeable personality. The class consisted of weekly online quizzes, two essays, a midterm, and a final. If you pay attention to her lectures and do the readings, you'll be fine. I would absolutely recommend taking a comparative politics class with her!"
8,5.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"very organized, and interesting lecture. easy to pay attention in class and many examples were given. there were a lot of readings but not super necessary. there were also weekly quizzes which boosted my grade"
9,5.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"Prof Anderson herself is an engaging lecturer. Taught us the content via real-world examples. She is clearly so passionate about this subject, extremely intelligent, and funny. I want to be her friend. All grading done by TAs. Two 5-7 page papers, a midterm, a final. Exams were a few robust term definitions + an essay. Will do well if you study."
10,4.0,4.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"Very cool, young, and relatable professor. Very knowledgable about what she teaches and explains it well. However, there are weekly quizzes that are very difficult and multiple essays. Lots of reading if you want an A."
11,5.0,4.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"Lectures are amazing and informational, but with tons of information to sort through. There is also a crazy amount of reading, which you are expected to remember for the midterms and final. Papers are graded pretty harshly, and midterm is essentially all writing and identifying terms. Great class, but not an easy A. "
12,5.0,4.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"The best lecturer I've had at UNC. Lectures are structured and connect the concepts of the class to real examples. Great intro to Polisci but is not an easy class. Lots of reading and keep up with notes. Midterm and final were very long and required you to know terms and authors, and papers were not graded easily."
13,4.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"I never really talked to Professor Anderson one-on-one, but she was a very effective lecturer. The class is mainly guided by TA's so she is really just there to maintain the stability of the course. She is very intelligent and you will learn a lot in her class."
14,4.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"Weekly quizzes, 2 papers, midterm, and final. Exams are both ID's (term definitions) and papers. Not hard at all if you put some effort in. Papers aren't bad either. TAs grade and were pretty easy. Quizzes were hard, but not big % of grade and 2 lowest were dropped. Prof was very knowledgable, interesting lectures and topics. Would recommend."
15,4.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,lots of readings for each week but you don't have to do them to pass the class. 2 papers and weekly quizzes which are not difficult and TA's don't grade papers harshly. Professor Anderson is very knowledgeable and this class was just interesting overall
16,5.0,4.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"This class was both one of the most challenging I've taken and one of the most interesting. The lectures are super fast and the quizzes are tough, but the paper topics are interesting. The midterm and final were hard, but doable if you studied well. She is willing to make adjustments for students as needed. "
17,4.0,2.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"Professor Anderson is not very accessible to get help, but TA's do a good job. On the other hand, she is brilliant in this subject and knows what she is talking about. I would take this class, but be prepared to read a lot for every lecture. She records lectures but if attendance is low she will stop so show up to class."
18,4.0,4.0, POLI233H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"I found Professor Anderson's lectures to be engaging and easy to follow. I didn't love how she was not very accessible via email, and she took forever to grade course assignments (2 papers, group presentation, final podcast) and the midterm. Nonetheless, she is passionate about what she teaches and the class was very interesting."
19,5.0,3.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,"Prof Anderson is an amazing lecturer and the content is so interesting. The class is made up of two papers, easy online quizzes, a midterm, and a final. The midterm and final really aren't difficult and the class average on each one was around an 89, so very manageable. Your grade depends on your TA, but not terribly hard. Very fun class."
20,3.0,4.0, POLI130,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ASHLEY,ANDERSON,I personally really enjoyed the content of the class. The lectures were engaging and I could tell Dr. Anderson really knew her material. The midterm and the final were ridiculously hard. I enjoyed my TA and she was easy to contact.
