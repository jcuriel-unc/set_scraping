1,5.0,3.0, SOC4609,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"Dr. Price-Spratlen is great. He's passionate and energetic, he's incredibly kind and incredibly smart. He teaches you how to think instead of what to think. I felt moved more than once during his lectures. He's difficult to follow though. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification. And don't bother emailing - just knock right on his office door."
2,1.0,3.0, SOC4609,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"This man is a passionate educator, however his lectures are regularly rambling sessions where you're never sure if the things he randomly writes on the chalkboard are testable material. Good luck studying your notes, because his slideshows make no sense, aren't descriptive, and he unnecessarily abbreviates words. Do NOT take a class with this man."
3,4.0,3.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,Hes a little all over the place but overall he was inspiring and a cool professor. East class
4,4.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,Dr. Price-Spratlen is a really nice guy who teaches a pretty interesting course. I took this class as a GE and was really intrigued by the information. He is very passionate about the subject and keeps you engaged. Assignments and exams are pretty straight forward if you show up and review presentations that he posts online.
5,5.0,3.0, SOC2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"Dr. Price-Spratlen was one of the most passionate educators I had the privilege of learning from during my 4 years at Ohio State. The course I took with him was just a GE and had nothing to do with my major, yet it was one of my favorite classes. He is a truly inspirational teacher and one of the best professors I have ever had."
6,4.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"He is honestly a great professor! He is definitely very sporadic and tends to go on tangents, but he definitely knows what he is talking about and keeps you awake and interested during class. The first half of the class uses a free online textbook, but you need to purchase his book for the second half (cheap). Overall good class; I would recommend!"
7,1.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,Great guy over all but I would never in my entire life tell someone to take his class. You'll want to pull your hair out every class. His intricate vocabulary and nonsensical demeanor will drive you insane. He makes you buy a textbook he wrote which pissed me off.  His slides make zero sense so good luck studying!
8,1.0,2.0, SOC4609,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"some of the worst lectures I have had to sit through in my entire life. He talks about the most irrelevant information. He is a scatter brained loon who should not teach a class. Makes you buy a book that he wrote, are you kidding me?  Do not take this class if you can avoid. He is a nice guy and it is an easy A, but will drive you insane all term"
9,3.5,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"You just show up for lecture, and have two tests and homework assignments. Participation is a big thing. He tends to not be so clear, because he side tracks a lot."
10,4.0,3.0, SOC3467,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"Townsand is great, but you won't like his class if you're not serious. He's a passionate and vastly intelligent instructor that doesn't dumb his material down. He has a tendency to lecture in dense academic jargon that can make simple concepts seem complicated. However, he is very kind and helpful. Expect class participation and to work in groups."
11,2.0,3.0, SOC4609,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"He's very ambiguous. Gives you a group paper and group assignments with no real directions. Luckily, they're not that hard and you can kind of do your own thing. Every week we had an in class assignment (writing your opinion) that was for a participation grade. His lectures don't make sense. MCQ on tests are easy, but the short answer are hard. "
12,1.0,5.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"Horrible teacher. He makes simple concepts much more difficult than what they should be. He is a tough grader, and his tests were kind of hard. He is always late to class and at the end he makes you write about a topic and it is graded. Also class participation is a must, even though he doesn't tell you it is. DON'T TAKE HIM!!!!"
13,4.5,1.0, SOC2345,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,The nicest guy I've ever met and my favorite professor at OSU--favorite teacher I've ever had.  You won't find anyone who cares more about their subject and it shows.  Always takes time to answer questions and entertain the ideas of every student.  Couldn't recommend him highly enough.
14,3.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"Slept through lectures, was barely awake for recitations. still got an A. here's how: BOOKS never read it, go to lectures and wake up for in-class writings, also attend recitation, 3 real easy essays that were max 2 pages. boom you got 50%. 1 mid term and final average 87 on multiple choice exams"
15,3.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"Very easy class. However, you need to attend lecture, or you miss information that shows up on tests. Only three homework assignments over the entire semester! And they're simple to do. He sometimes goes off on tangents or loses clarity. He's really goofy, and uses strong hand gestures. However, he's clearly passionate about what he's teaching!"
16,4.0,2.0, SOC2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"He is the nicest guy in the whole world. He is really energetic and LOVES the subject on which he's teaching. He is passionate about sociology, and as long as you go to class and participate, you'll get a good grade. You have to pay attention, otherwise you might miss some key information because he moves quickly and is a LITTLE confusing."
17,1.0,4.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"He has very strong hand gestures. very difficult to follow. He basically turns a very simple concept into more than one whole lecture.  Slow on grades, does not email you back AT ALL, and very unorganized.  Difficult to succeed"
18,2.5,3.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"Takes far too long to get grades in, which is inexcusable because his tests are Scantron with short answers. Has very awkward mannerisms that disrupt the flow of his teaching. His chosen subject matter has little relevance considering it's about pre-tweens that know nothing about the significance of sex and religion. Avoid."
19,3.0,3.0, SOC367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"Very enthusiastic and never stops moving. He's definitely smart, but too smart for his own good. He sees all sorts of connections between concepts but struggles to explain it to students. He tries to explain things but can't maintain a clear train of thought. Always late to class, but he tries to help outside of class if you can reach him."
20,1.5,3.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TOWNSAND,PRICE-SPRATLEN,"Very difficult to understand at times, he uses a vocabulary fit for perhaps graduate school, not a 101 class. Class is mandatory and is graded by little writings at the end of every class. It was painfully difficult to stay awake during his repeated definitions time and time again"
