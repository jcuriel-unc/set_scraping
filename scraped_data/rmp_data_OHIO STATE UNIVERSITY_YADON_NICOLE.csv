1,5.0,2.0, POLISCI-3910,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NICOLE,YADON,Professor Yadon was great for POLISCI 3910. She utilized both lectures and discussions to keep students engaged. She's also extremely caring and wants students to do well. I had many personal issues this semester and she emailed me multiple times trying to make sure I stayed on track. She was very helpful. It's obvious she wants students to do well
