Although the material is dense and the exams can be tricky, there are many opportunities to boost your grade. The tests are also online and take-home."

She is very patient and will go out of her way to make sure you understand a concept.  Don't get me wrong, this class is tough and there is a lot of material, but the way she teaches makes you feel very prepared for exams!"
6,5.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHVETA,PAREKH,Dr. Parekh is a professor who cares about her students. This class is not an easy class since there is a lot to learn and memorize but she tries her best to help her students. She is accessible outside of class for any questions or just chatting. Don't buy the textbook it is available online! She gives optional guided readings which are nice.
