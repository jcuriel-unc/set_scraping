1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRANDON,TURNER,"Very solid professor. Super nice and funny little jokes here and there to keep the class awake. Definitely go to class, the powerpoints dont have enough text to get by just downloading them and not paying any attention. Also, in-class tophat is pretty much just participation points. Study a couple days in advance for exams and youll be fine."
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH5621,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRANDON,TURNER,"Intro to ERP was a difficult class only because the concepts were very in depth, but he and the TA went easy on the grading because of this. I really felt like a lot of information was cut out because it was so detailed. This probably could be two or three classes. You will also learn how to code."
3,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRANDON,TURNER,Dr. Turner's class exams were RIDICULOUSLY difficult. He expected you to recall examples from class from MONTHS prior to the exam without informing you that it would be on the exam. His test is strictly memorization and less about learning the content. Good luck trying to get a meeting with him because he is only in Columbus 2 days a week.
4,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRANDON,TURNER,He is pretty good. I'd recommend him. My only complaint is he wears sweaters a bit too often for my taste. I think it's unhealthy.
5,4.0,4.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRANDON,TURNER,Can be confusing because he doesnt always have text explaining some slides but if you go to class you usually get what he means. Likes to focus on studies behind concepts which is nice. Has some relatively easy hw assignments to help your grade and his exams arent too bad. study 1-2 days for them. Super helpful with questions.  Nice guy.
6,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRANDON,TURNER,lectures are lengthy and sometimes cause info overload. he really is passionate about cognitive neuroscience but his lectures are tiring. simple assignments and few and far between but article readings are long. be prepared for awkward silences to ensue during lectures.
7,4.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BRANDON,TURNER,"Sometimes is a bit unclear or a bit dry in lectures, but all in all, he is a really smart dude and really enthusiastic about cognitive neuroscience. The class wasn't very hard to begin with, but he was always very willing to help students and to ensure that everyone succeeded. "
