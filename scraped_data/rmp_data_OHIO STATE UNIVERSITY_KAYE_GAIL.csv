1,3.0,3.0, 4067,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,Class was unorganized and lectures were not engaging.
2,4.0,2.0, PUBHHBP3510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,"Very very sweet woman! Posts the cutest weekly update videos for the class. Lots of the grading/lecturing is done by the TAs, but Prof Kaye was very quick to answer any emails/questions I had. Not a very difficult class, the weekly assignments definitely forced me to learn the material and were sometimes long but never really hard!"
3,5.0,1.0, PUBHHMP3510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,"Dr. Kaye is such a wonderful person. I genuinely felt bad for skipping her lectures so often because she is such a kind-hearted soul. However, with that being said, it is probably the easiest class I have taken in college and definitely one of the most tedious. Loved the professor, definitely wished she taught a different class though."
4,4.0,2.0, PUBHHMP3510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,"Gail is so sweet and caring. She reminds me of my own grandmother. The class is very straightforward and easy to do well in as long as you do the weekly assignments (some of which are worth as much as your final exam). The content is very interesting, but most of the time I learned it all myself before the two exams. No class on Friday."
5,5.0,2.0, PUBHHMP3510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,"Gail is great! This was one of my favorite classes, 2 tests worth 10 and 15% of your grades. Weekly assignments with really clear directions, no class on Fridays. Would really recommend this class."
6,3.5,1.0, PUBHHMP3510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,Nice Prof. Easy A. Daily attendance not necessary but there are random pop quizzes (10) on readingclass activities throughout the semester. Study guides tell you exactly what info from the power points for the midterm and final. Group projectpaper was a huge pain. 
7,3.0,2.0, NUTR310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,"I didnt attend this class very much after the first exam.She gives us the powerpoints online between that and the book I didnt need the class.She basically just goes over the powerpoints anyway.I attended maybe five or six classes and still got an A.But I did study alot my main issue is she doesn't tell you what you miss on quizzes,just the grade."
8,4.0,4.0, NUTR210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,I took this class because I had interest and it fulfilled my GEC requirement.  However she went a lot more indepth and made it much harder than it needed to be.  While it was interesting it was extremely difficult.  I read the book and attended every class and still struggled.
9,4.0,3.0, NUTRI310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,Took class online. very boring. out of 500 points 260 are practically given. the rest is the midterm and final..120 each. This class is basically like biology. Material is pretty tricky and test questions are extremely detailed. Carmen discussions are helpful. If you keep up with the reading you'll be fine. I didn't and still got a B+.
10,2.5,4.0, HUMNU210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,Dr. Kaye is extremely nice but I had a really difficult time in this class with exams.  There are a lot of easy assignment points and online quizzes but the tests were so hard.  The averages of the first 2 tests wer 71% and 63%. I'm hoping for a B- in the class. :-(
11,3.0,4.0, HN210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,"Don't take the class, i thought i could get through it but i was wrong. It is so so boring, i actually fell asleep during lecture in a huge lecture hall. Material is difficult which i do not understand since it is just an intro class. she also assigns busy work that is completely pointless. And she is annoying-exaggerates her lame east coast accent"
12,4.5,2.0, HN210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,Her lecture isn't the most exciting hour ever but the information she presents is clear.  She is extremely understanding and helpful if you need extra help or considerations....just ask in office hours.
13,4.0,2.0, HN210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,"The class was pretty easy.  She read everything straight from the slides, which were available online so basically I hardly ever went to class.  She does offer extra credit points from time to time for attendance, needless to say I didnt get any but I did recieve an A- in the class anyway. Read the notes and read your book, you'll be A OK"
14,3.5,2.0, HNTR210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,"not that bad, never bought the book and got an easy A."
15,3.0,4.0, HN210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,"Tests harder than you think. Need to read book and study the in class notes. She would throw in random questions especially calculations that she didnt say you needed to know. Nice lady, but not too great with her tests."
16,4.5,3.0, HUMNNTR210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,I think she is a great professor!!! Lots of information but she tries to make it easier. Quite a few extra credits which made me get an A-!
17,1.0,2.0, 210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,"This lady is terrible. Bad at lecturing, bad at helping, bad overall."
18,4.5,2.0, HUMNTR210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,I totally disagree with everyones comments and ratings. Gail Kaye was an excellent teacher and she really made the class fun. Her test were challenging but they were not that difficult if you studied
19,2.0,5.0, HN210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,"i took this class last quarter on top of chemistry and stats and i was hating life. it is a lot harder than it should be. however, the final is literally made up of questions that were cut and pasted from the previous exams. study the previous exams for the final and nothing else."
20,3.5,3.0, HN210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GAIL,KAYE,Class is harder than it needs to be but get to drop 1 exam grade. She was nice to me when I talked to her. I agree the tests are tricky and throw in random facts from the book that weren't on the study guide.
