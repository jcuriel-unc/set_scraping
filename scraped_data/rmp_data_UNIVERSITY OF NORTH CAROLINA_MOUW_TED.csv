1,5.0,3.0, SOCI427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,"This is my third class with Ted, so you can guess that I'd take more if I weren't graduating! The work load is above average, but the readings are typically interesting which helps a lot. You get to explore some unique topics as well. Class is discussion-based, so if you don't prefer this format, it's not the class for you."
2,5.0,3.0, SOCI702,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,Ted is one of the kindest professors that I have had in my career. The man makes an extremely difficult subject like statistics accessible and comprehensible to most people including 'non-statisticians' such as me. He genuinely cares for his students and will do his utmost to help them succeed in the class. A gem of a man!!
3,5.0,2.0, SOCI427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,Awesome professor! My favorite class I've taken at UNC. You learn a lot by just interacting and discussing with your classmates and Ted. Not a lot of work and 4 essays including the final. Easy class and worthwhile. Thanks Ted!
4,5.0,2.0, SOCI427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,"Ted is hands down the BEST professor at UNC. He is so understanding and honestly just a great professor. no tests, just 4 reading questions and 3 SHORT essays (3 pages max) and one final 5-page paper. take him at any chance you can, you seriously wont regret it. i wish i took him for all my mngt classes!! class is all discussion based as well!!!!!"
5,5.0,2.0, SOCI058,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,"Can not recommend enough. The class is mainly discussion on the readings (which there are a decent amount). He does a really good job trying to include everyone in the conversation. There are small assignments before every class on the readings. A few essays throughout the semester, but not too bad and he is understanding about circumstances."
6,5.0,2.0, SOCI58,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,"SOCI58 is a class entirely based around discussion, and professor Mouw facilitates very interesting discussions on a variety of world topics. He is extremely kind, and was very flexible over the course of the semester. A great first year seminar and Professor Mouw is the perfect person to lead it. Only 3 papers on topics discussed in class"
7,5.0,2.0, SOCI058,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,There's around 40-50 pages of reading with 4 questions due before every class and 3 papers (3 pages double spaced) along with a final paper (min 6 pages) that is based on any topic from class. Participation is extremely important. He's super accommodating and the discussions are really interesting! I highly recommend this class!
8,5.0,3.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,"I can't recommend Ted enough! He's kind and will work with you on deadlines if needed. There's a fair amount of reading and you must turn in reading notes every class, but they're very easy. The class was entirely discussion-based, so you need to participate! He's been accommodating with COVID, too. Take a class with him if you get the chance!!"
9,5.0,4.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,"Ted is a super caring prof, and I've taken multiple classes with him and will continue to take more if I can. If you have difficulties making a deadline, he will work with you and is very accomodating. There is a fair amount of reading, and he will make you work to achieve the A, but it shouldn't deter you from taking his classes!"
10,5.0,2.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,So understanding and kind. Loves facilitating discussion. Assigns papers and daily reading notes but they're ezpz. Pulled thru for pandemic and made the final 10 T/F questions that we went over in class.
11,5.0,2.0, SOCI58,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,Ted is my favorite professor that I've had this semester. He cares so deeply about his students and is so understanding as he would rather see us get a good night's sleep than stay up to write an essay even if it means turning it in the next morning. He is so knowledgeable and provides incredibly insightful commentary. Cannot recommend him enough!!
12,5.0,2.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,Fantastic professor. Very enthusiastic about the material.
13,5.0,2.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,"Ted is LITERALLY AMAZING!!! so caring and understanding. super sweet and you get positive vibes. 3 SHORT essays (3 pages at max) and 1 5-page essay due at the end of the semester. Reading notes due before every class, but VERY easy (3-4 questions). If you have the opportunity to take him, do it!! you will NOT regret it!"
14,5.0,2.0, SOCI058,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,"Professor was incredibly helpful, accomodating, and nice. Participation matters but he makes it easy for you to participate and encourages you to speak. Will call on you if you look like you're spacing out but he's only trying to help you. Readings are interesting; he isn't harsh with grading and the assignments are easy."
15,5.0,3.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,Professor Mouw really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He is very accessible outside of class and accommodating for the final paper. Readings and class discussions are interesting. He's very funny and shares hilarious stories about his life. Even if you do the readings and come to class it's hard to get an A
16,5.0,2.0, SOCI058,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,He is definitely one of the best professors I have ever had. He is a really funny and super caring professor while also making the lecture fun. He assigns a reading guide every class that has four questions which will take 30 min max. The in-class essays are super easy as long as you pay some attention in class.
17,5.0,2.0, SOCI711,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,Dr Mouw is one of the nicest profs that i have come across. Although he deals with a difficult subject he deeply cares for his students and genuinely wants them to succeed. he isnt in the business of looking good. rather he wants to the best he can to help the students. no one fails in his class. that is his biggest success. i love him
18,4.0,3.0, SOCI58,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,"Ted is really funny, caring, and kind. He seems genuinely passionate about the subject. Participation is a HUGE part of this class. You need to come in ready to speak because he will call on you if it looks like you aren't paying attention. There's assignments of around 60 pages of reading and writing 4 short paragraphs due for each class."
19,5.0,2.0, SOCI058,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,"He's a great teacher. LOVES extended discussions so be ready to talk if you want to do well! There are reading notes (not too long) for every class so that's a bit tedious. Also, there's a 6 page paper and a final. Overall pretty easy but you got some work to do!"
20,5.0,2.0, SOCI412,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TED,MOUW,"Ted cares about you as a student, and is flexible with work if you email him ahead of time. There are reading notes due every time the class meets and are based on 30-50 pages, which can be overwhelming but he puts the page number where you can find the questions information and that helps a lot. He's really passionate about the subjects."
