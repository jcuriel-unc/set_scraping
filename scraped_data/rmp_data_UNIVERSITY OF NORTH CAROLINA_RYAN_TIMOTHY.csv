1,3.0,4.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,Professor Ryan while nice is kinda disorganized and sporadic.Class moved at an extremely fast pace and the main coding assignments often had questions that not even the ULAs who had the answer key really understood how to reach the correct answer.Assignment guidelines were often confusing and having the right answer doesn't equal full credit
2,3.0,5.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"Grading is a complete mystery done by a TA with minimal explanation. At first, the lectures walk you through coding but then you get nothing but definitions. The assignments and final were insanely difficult and he kept falling behind schedule. This meant we had greatly reduced time for the final and it was graded harshly compared to the rubric."
3,3.0,4.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"6 assignments and a group final project. Extremely boring and inefficient lectures but easy enough to get through while mastering almost none of the material. He does not explain grading criteria very well so you can get a bad grade out of nowhere. Not difficult, just causes unnecessary amounts of stress and very boring lectures."
4,3.0,4.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,This class gave me so much anxiety. Assignments were graded harshly and instructions were unclear. 
5,2.0,5.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN, A friend of mine is taking it now and I was reminded of just how tough the class is. It would be helpful if lectures were a bit more useful.  
6,5.0,3.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"Prof. Ryan is a great professor in terms of learning practical data skillsets in R. I would highly suggest that all POLI students take his two Data in Politics classes (281 & 381), since they develop essential skills for social/political science research. This class also got me into coding, which I never would have expected."
7,4.0,3.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"POLI281 is a great class for people who need the QR credit but can't code/do math! Professor Ryan teaches in a way that helps us understand what's going on, at least most of the time. I found the lectures to be redundant so didn't pay attention much, but the groups help. The format of the class does a good job of actually helping us understand."
8,5.0,3.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"Professor Ryan is an amazing professor, he is very receptive to and understanding towards his students. I had previous coding experiences so I didn't have too much struggle with the assignments."
9,5.0,3.0, POLI100H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"Def take POLI100 with Prof. Ryan! The only papers are two dope amendment assignment and both midterms + the final are take-home, open book, and open internet. He's a really kind and open-minded guy who won't hold it against you if you disagree with his POV as long as you give solid reasoning. Chill with deadlines and is always cool for extensions."
10,5.0,4.0, POLI381,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,Really nice guy who gives super engaging lectures and is really supportive of students.
11,5.0,4.0, POLI281,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"He's one of the best! Has a great, intriguing personality, is extremely helpful, and WANTS his students to succeed in the course. No, he won't give you an A if you don't deserve it, but he will spend whatever amount of time it takes working with you to get you there. Definitely take a class with him if you get the chance!"
12,5.0,2.0, POLI100H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,Honestly incredibly underrated. Class has a lot of readings but prof Ryan is fantastic. He challenges you to think critically. A's are not too hard. I learned a ton.
13,5.0,2.0, POLI100H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,Professor Ryan was amazing! Very easy class if you do the readings (which are interesting) and participate in class. There are papers are projects but are easily graded. The tests are open note and they are fair questions that are discussed in some way in class.
14,5.0,3.0, POLI417,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,Professor Ryan is an awesome teacher and is so passionate about what he teaches! He inspires students to dig deeper into class topics and is always super helpful.
15,5.0,4.0, POLI417,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,Professor Ryan is one of my favorite professors of all time! He is an amazing teacher and you will learn so much from his class. He loves what he teaches and really wants his students to succeed. The class is so interesting -- one of my favorite I've taken at Carolina.
16,4.0,2.0, POLI417H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"Professor Ryan is a fun guy in class. He keeps you engaged but has a problem ending class on time because he's a talker. Midterm and final are only 5 questions, but he does let you use the readings. Research project at the end of the semester is fun but takes time"
17,5.0,3.0, POLI417H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"Professor Ryan is a great professor, who manages to make class exciting even when the subject material isn't always exciting. He is super passionate, and will go out of his way to make sure that you understand the material. Great professor, and if you are a Political Science major his class is a must take."
18,4.5,2.0, POLI100H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"Professor Ryan is a really great teacher. You can tell he knows what he's talking about and he's really good at staying un-biased/not letting his political views affect his teaching. Not too heavy of a workload, the tests and blog posts are very manageable if you put in the time to prepare. I would take this class again, definitely recommend!"
19,5.0,1.0, POLI417,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"Professor Ryan is a really chill dude and while you don't have to go to class, it will affect your participation grade. He doesn't like tests and as such the few he does give are easy and the class is geared mainly toward learning how to do things rather than learning a bunch of random information. Class was loaded with group projects though. "
20,3.5,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,TIMOTHY,RYAN,"He's a nice guy, fair grader, wants the best for you. Really into the blogs which is the better alternative than the NYT thing with Conover. He doesn't get visibly annoyed, although you can tell he's not happy when half the class doesn't show. (Attendance wasn't necessarily mandatory) You get what you put into the class. Take notes."
