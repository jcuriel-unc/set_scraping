1,2.0,4.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,CHRISTOFFEL,"As someone who likes biopsychology and understands it, I didn't like this class at all. Professor Christoffel just read off his slides and his lectures were long and not engaging. Tests were cumulative and unnecessarily difficult which dragged my overall grade down. There is a group project which is easy to get full points on. "
2,5.0,3.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,CHRISTOFFEL,"Tbh Dr. C isn't bad.  Sure, the first paper was a little rough, but just the rubric for the others, and you're fine.  Exams were not too awful if you study.  Take- home quizzes/scientist spotlights were grade buffers.  Also, you can always email him to talk about grade issues.  And he always let class out early. Overall, not a TERRIBLE class."
3,2.0,4.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,CHRISTOFFEL,"Just don't. Lectures were so painfully boring and sometimes vague and exams were insanely precise. No feedback was given on assignments, you just got a grade for no reason. His exams were SO unorganized, even though they were online and automatically graded they were graded wrong. Do yourself a favor and take it with someone else."
4,2.0,5.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,CHRISTOFFEL,He has been one of the worst professors I have had at UNC so far. You basically have to teach yourself the material and the exams are very detailed. He seems to not care about teaching at all and lectures right off of the slides. He doesn't give feedback on papers and the lectures are not engaging at all. Take PSYC 220 with anyone else!
5,1.0,5.0, PSYC-220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,CHRISTOFFEL,Dr. Christoffel was the worst professor I have had so far. It was clear he did not care about his students or teaching in general. He graded extremely harshly with little to no guidance or explanation. Take with someone else!!!
6,2.0,5.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,CHRISTOFFEL,"I really did not like Dr. Christoffel because he wasn't good at lecturing, tests were wildly hard, we always left class early (meaning it feels like we missed a lot of content that was still on tests). Group project is easy. There is no feedback on the 4 papers due throughout the semester (got a 76 on one with no explanation). I do not recommend"
7,2.0,4.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,CHRISTOFFEL,"Do not recommend. Extremely boring lectures, difficult tests, and he clearly was just not prepared to teach this class. One time the highest exam score was an 89 and he did not curve at all. The group projects and pre-class quizzes did boost your grade, though."
8,3.0,3.0, PSYC220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,CHRISTOFFEL,"Content is pretty cool; class could have been a lot better if Dr. C was more enthusiastic & accessible. Quite obvious he didn't care much about us, he would answer questions in class but wasn't helpful beyond that. Beginning of class was a wreck as he didn't provide any insight on grading or studying criteria. Tests and lectures are overly detailed"
9,1.0,5.0, PSYC-220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,CHRISTOFFEL,"Not a great professor. Nothing has clear grading standards, you can get a failing grade on a paper with literally no feedback. Exams are hard as hell (all of the test averages are in the 70s) and lectures are short without enough info. Do not recommend. "
10,1.0,5.0, PSYC-220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,CHRISTOFFEL,"Dr. Christoffel's lectures were monotone and didn't really provide anything that you couldn't gain from the book. He tried to take attendance but his pollev's never worked, and while the quizzes were really easy the exams were very hard. We had to beg him to give us a rubric for papers, but at least he lets class out early. Take with someone else!"
11,1.0,3.0, PSYC-220,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DANIEL,CHRISTOFFEL,"He can come off as condescending/rude. He lectures monotone the whole time, and he doesn't even try to keep students engaged. He grades papers harshly and doesn't give feedback. The questions on exams can seem random but aren't too bad if you study. You can get a good grade if you put in the effort, but I'd take this class with anyone else."
