1,2.0,4.0, SOCI251,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BARBARA,ENTWISLE,"Assignments were generally easy to complete and the material wasn't hard but the exams felt like you were set up to fail. There wasn't any one I spoke to who felt confident about the exams so no matter how much you study, its not going to work out. Also the group projects felt repetitive. "
2,3.0,2.0, SOCI251,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BARBARA,ENTWISLE,"Prof Entwisle makes class easy enough, but the big project we worked on all semester was broken into small assignments that felt repetitive. No tests or quizzes though, just open-note in-class assessments, which was great."
3,5.0,2.0, SOCI251,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BARBARA,ENTWISLE,"Prof. Entwisle entirely re-structured the class once COVID started. There were no exams, quizzes, etc - only small individual assignments and a large group project that spanned over about half the semester. Participation is important. Overall I really liked the way the class was designed for online learning and would highly rec this course."
4,5.0,3.0, SOCI251,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BARBARA,ENTWISLE,"Her classes are very structured and you can tell she has done this for many years. She is clear about what we are learning and explains concepts well. The vocab quizzes are really easy and straightforward, but you will need to study well for tests. She is a very kind and competent teacher - not sure what others are saying."
5,2.0,2.0, SOCI251,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BARBARA,ENTWISLE,"She doesn't give tell you much about what's on exams. Exams cover things not always covered in class. Exams have test corrections, but you need them because typically people make in the 70s for her exams without test corrections. Class is a little boring, but just show up."
6,3.0,2.0, SOCI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BARBARA,ENTWISLE,"Professor Entwisle is very knowledgeable, but the class got a little boring at times. This seminar on American universities definitely didn't feel like a sociology class."
