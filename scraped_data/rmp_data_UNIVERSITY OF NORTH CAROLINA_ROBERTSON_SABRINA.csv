1,5.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"Dr. Robertson is amazing- the class structure was sometimes a lot to keep up with because of how dense the material is, but she really cares and knows what she is talking about. Her exams were very fair and had no tricks, which was super comforting. She also emphasized daily how if we were struggling in any way she was available for help. "
2,5.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"LOVE this woman. NSCI 175 is an incredibly hard class, but she did her best to make it easier for students, including lots of extra credit. She is super sweet and exams aren't too bad, there is just a lot of information to cover. I definitely recommend taking her for 175!"
3,5.0,2.0, NSCI326,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"Dr. Robertson is the best professor I've had at UNC! She cares a lot about her students and is very passionate about her classes. This specific course was super helpful as it is focused around networking, building your resume, etc. It was a great way to ""force"" yourself to network. I would recommend this course and this professor to anyone at UNC! "
4,5.0,4.0, NSCI423,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"Professor Robertson is one of the sweetest professors you will ever have. This class is hard but honestly, she is so accommodating and understanding that you are genuinely excited to go every time. She loves what she does and it comes through. I would opt into this hard class, as it was incredibly interesting and so applicable to the world."
5,5.0,4.0, NSCI423,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"This class was one of my favorites! Reading many research papers and analyzing them, there are a lot of assignments to keep out for but they aren't too difficult, just manage your time. Exams were fair and so was her grading! You really learn a lot in this course. Dr. Robertson was very accomodating and one of the best/sweetest professors Ive had!"
6,5.0,2.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"Dr. Robertson's class is overall really great. She provides learning objectives which clearly layout what she's looking for on exams and on homework readings. The readings still take a lot of time since the course covers a wide array of topics, but overall it's manageable. I would definitely recommend taking a class with Dr. Robertson."
7,5.0,3.0, NSCI423,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"Dr. Robertson is an amazing professor. There is A LOT of group work so if that isn't your thing, don't take this class. It is a lot of work but you will learn very valuable, applicable things. Two exams (on Sakai) and they were challenging, but she gives SO many opportunities to get extra points to boost your grade. Very accommodating and nice!"
8,5.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"I LOVED taking this class with Dr. Roberston. She is honestly one of the most caring professors I have ever had. Homework does require a good amount of reading, but this is an intro class so lots of information has to be covered. Her ""Learning Outcomes"" help A LOT for exams. I would definitely recommend this class with Dr. Roberston!!"
9,5.0,3.0, NSCI693H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"Living legend. I love Sabrina Robertson! I only had her for NSCI693H, which only meets once a week and isn't a traditional class, but she was an excellent mentor/guide. It seems like she is incredibly busy, so props to her for keeping a high standard of excellence across a wide range of activities. Very impressive. Take any class she teaches."
10,5.0,2.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,Great Professor. Look at the ppt's to help study for tests. There's a TON of reading though.
11,5.0,4.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"Dr. Robertson is wonderful. She's nice and helpful, but unfortunately, the nature of the course makes it hard to get proper help in office hours bc so many students take 175. There's just not enough time one-on-one if you're really struggling. This is def a weed-out course. It wasn't the hardest thing in the world, but you do have to work for an A."
12,5.0,4.0, NSCI423,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"I wasnt sure I was going to like this class, but I enjoyed it. Dr. Robertson was extremely accommodating this semester. Her exams are very fair, and theres a lot of work to buff your grade in case you do bad on exams. Shes a gem!"
13,5.0,4.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"Prof Robertson is very kind and understanding. However, the work load in the class is very heavy, be prepared for lots of quizzes and reading. But the tests weren't too bad as long as you review material and the PowerPoints."
14,5.0,4.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"Dr. Robertson was an amazing, caring professor. Her lectures were always interesting and understandable. I didn't love the group work element of her class, so that was a bit annoying. She has very clear expectations about what you needed to know for exams, which made it easy to succeed in her class. Unlike most STEM classes, grades are spread out."
15,5.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"Dr. Robertson is a caring and knowledgeable professor. Her class is graded by multiple things (quizzes, daily work, polls, exams, etc) which allows one to receive a decent grade. Her lectures are interesting and useful. However, the course becomes more difficult as the semester ends and the lectures will not include all the info on tests."
16,3.0,4.0, NSCI423,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"If you don't want to participate or work primarily in groups, don't take this class. VERY HEAVY GROUP-WORK AND PARTICIPATION!! Two moderately difficult MC exams (make sure you take good notes during journal clubs for them) and the final is a presentation of your group's semester-long research proposal. Every class period there's a lot of pre-work."
17,5.0,3.0, PSYC490,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,This course had some conceptually complex material but Dr. Robertson's instruction made them completely digestible. The tests were not that difficult. There were many academic papers for reading but the journal clubs held made them less intimidating/easier to understand. One large group project at the end but a lot of assistance so not bad at all.
18,5.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,Dr. Robertson really cares about teaching but she does use active learning techniques. I found her class structure incredibly helpful - she organizes the course and coursework in a logical way that basically gives you all the tools you need to ace the exams and homework. Follow the learning objectives she gives and you're golden.
19,5.0,2.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,"Dr. Robertson is the sweetest professor ever. She truly cares about her students. Her lectures are pretty good, and she's great at explaining concepts. One aspect I didn't like is the little group discussions during class. There is a lot of info in neuro and she gives you all the info you'll need to succeed. Her exams aren't too difficult."
20,5.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SABRINA,ROBERTSON,Dr. Robertson is the best! She truly cares about all of her students. I was nervous about taking neuroscience but Dr. Robertson was an excellent instructor and clearly communicated to us how we can succeed in her class. It does require a lot of studying - but if you put in the effort it's very manageable!
