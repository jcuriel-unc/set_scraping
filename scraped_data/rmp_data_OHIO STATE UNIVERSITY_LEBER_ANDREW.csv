1,2.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,Grade is mainly test based and communication outside of classroom is not that great. 
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,Dr. Leber was awesome. Genuinely enjoyed his class. He's so funny and his sense of humor is perfect for engaging college kids. Attendance isn't mandatory and lectures are recorded which is great. Exams are all multiple choice and totally fair. Easy class for Neuro majors.
3,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"Dr. Leber was such a great professor! You can tell he is very passionate about what he teaches and ALWAYS answered student questions. The pace of the class was very manageable (sometimes a bit slow but I can't complain about that) and he gave helpful study guides for exams. As long as you attend lecture and do the study guide, it's an easy A!"
4,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"Dr. Leber is funny and just a very welcoming person in general. I was never scared to ask him a question! His quizzes and exams were very fair, and he graded papers very leniently too. I was not a big fan of the weekly breakout room session, but I understand why he did them."
5,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"We did group discussions (breakout rooms) that were worth a lot, but it was basically if you showed up and submitted something, you were fine. Tests were fair, he's honestly just such an awesome guy. So understanding during the pandemic, definitely the teacher I'd recommend for this class!"
6,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"legit a dad figure. Such a great guy. I will take any class he offers because he makes class so much fun. not only is it fun, he makes neuroscience easy to understand and is always super helpful. He tries to make his class a ""sanctuary"" and it really is. Seriously though, love this guy. You won't regret taking his class."
7,2.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"The class itself is not terribly hard, however, IT'S SO BORING. His voice is monotone which makes paying attention to the already boring material very hard. He claims he only tests on material from his study guide and then puts random material on his exams that were not from the study guide. Good guy, BAD teacher!"
8,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,I LOVED DR LEBER!! I always recommend him to anyone. I just studied the slides and I was fine. He's really not out to get you.
9,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"He's really cool, passionate and interesting. Recommend him. His lecture consists of: 50% jokes (ehich I really cannot always get) and cute puppies or some other animals, 20% about personal experience, mostly academic experience, 30% real lecture which is awesome. Class is not hard, just pay attention and rebiew carefully, then you'll ace it."
10,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"Dr. Leber is amazing, he's a really cool guy, and he reminds me of Shaggy from Scooby-Doo. Psych 3513 was literally a joke. Just read the slides and make sure you know all the terms on the study guides he gives and you'll get an A."
11,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"Professor Leber is very passionate about cognitive psychology, and would often share personal research stories, which definitely enhanced the course. His exams were based off the lectures, but it helped to look up things in more depth in the textbook, as the exam questions sometimes required a deeper level of understanding."
12,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"Great guy, explains everything well. Does call out people for cell phone usage but he is genuinely a great lecturer. Not many assignments and exams were very doable. Great class!"
13,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"I LOVE Dr. Leber. He plays animal videos before each class and he's just such a pure human. He really enjoys psychology, and he does his best to make the material interesting. This class is very simple and he posts study guides for each exam. The final is cumulative, but fill out the study guide and you'll be fine. He cracks jokes a lot too."
14,3.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"His lectures can be a little dry, but the class is super easy to get an A in."
15,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"I loved having Dr. Leber! He was super interested in the subject material and made a long lecture fun with his humor. Tests are super fair, he gives a study guide and as long as you understand the material, you should have no problem doing well. With a slight curve, I got above 100 on one of his midterms. He's a really nice guy, too."
16,2.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"Let me at least give hime this: he's a super nice guy. However that's where the list of positives ends. His lectures are dry, I could barely make it through the class and dreaded going to it every day. Half way through the semester I stopped going. He obviously tries, but this was the single most boring and hated class I've ever had."
17,4.0,4.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,Leber gives lectures with really interesting examples (often old psych experiments) and is funny and a very cheesy way. His tests are fair but have some questions that you would only know from in-class lectures. He had a few HW articles with short quizzes that were really just checking if you read the article.
18,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"He teaches the material well because he's an expert in the field (he has a lab, does experiments). Relates things to real life and his in class demonstrations help in remembering for the exams. Has quizzes, papers, and midterms. All are reasonable. You will learn from his class."
19,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"Professor Leber is a really nice guy and always plays cute animal videos before class. He seems to genuinely care about the class and although Cog Neuro material can be dull, he does his best to keep everyone somewhat engaged."
20,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANDREW,LEBER,"He knows a lot and will help you if you ever need anything. Lectures are not too fast, has powerpoints online, grading is straight forward, you will want to take him again. (keep an eye out for his jokes, subtle at times but hilarious if you get it) plus he's tall and kinda cuute.."
