1,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL4511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANA,HAYNIE,"Prof Haynie is so sweet, obviously cares about her students and always responds quickly to emails. You have about 5 assignments per week but they aren't hard and you can get them done in about 1-2 hours. She doesn't grade strictly at all; as long as you put in effort you'll get full credit. Overall, I liked this class and would take Dana again. "
2,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL4511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANA,HAYNIE,"The best professor I have had during this pandemic! Lots of little assignments, but the lectures are pre-recorded and she didn't give us a final paper like she had planned to help us out. Really cares about her students and their well being. We need more professors like this at OSU."
3,5.0,3.0, SOC4511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANA,HAYNIE,"She is honestly the most caring person ever. Dont skip class and you will 100% get an A. The exams are pretty easy if you just read the textbook chapters before the test, but she structures the class so that even if you dont test well but come to class you will get an A. All the other assignments are crazy easy."

5,3.0,2.0, SOIC4511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANA,HAYNIE,Such a great teacher. I took juvenile delinquency with her. She truly cares about what she teaches and her students. Very interesting class and makes it fun for the entire class. Shows a lot of video clips. Make sure to go to class because top hat is used. Writing assignments on carmen but easy and straight forward!
6,5.0,2.0, SOC4511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANA,HAYNIE,I took Juvenile Delinquency with her and it was amazing! She loves what she teaches and her lectures are very interesting. She uses top hat throughout the class and there are a lot of little assignments on Carmen but they are just reading questions and are easy. The exams are easy after you review the lectures and text book.
7,5.0,1.0, SOC4511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANA,HAYNIE,I took Juvenile Delinquency with her and it was awesome! She loves what she teaches and that comes across clearly in her lectures. There are a lot of little assignments on Carmen but they're straightforward and easy. The exams are easy after a quick review of the book chapters. Definitely take this class with her!!
