1,3.0,5.0, PUBHBIO7220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STANLEY,LEMESHOW,"Lemeshow is a good guy, super smart. Hes not a great teacher. He expects everyone to be a statistician and teaches over our heads often. The class isnt unfair, but he just reads from his notes and spits out statistical jargon. He sometime tells fun stories though that help."
2,5.0,4.0, PUBHBIO6210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STANLEY,LEMESHOW,Goes very quickly but explains things well and gives partial credit on tests.
3,5.0,1.0, PUBHBIO7220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STANLEY,LEMESHOW,Boss dog was AWESOME. Dr. Lemeshow is a seasoned statistician with amazing stories from his past experiences.
4,1.5,5.0, PUBHBIO7220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STANLEY,LEMESHOW,Dr.Lemeshow feels annoyed when asked to clarify. He is a a great scientist but his teaching is not clear. He is very fast and does not explain everything needed.
5,3.5,5.0, BIO702,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STANLEY,LEMESHOW,Very difficult- I flew through 701 but almost didnt pass this course. Notes seem fairly straightforward but tests can seem overwhelming. Be sure to understand the notes instead of just memorizing or you'll be out of luck on the exams. Failed a large portion of the class.
6,1.5,5.0, BIOS999,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STANLEY,LEMESHOW,"Lemeshow is more brilliant than I will ever be. I sucked in the class. However, he is not as good an instructor as  Drs. Burr and Shen. Both of them left OSU, under Lemeshow as the Dean. Didn't suck up to him enough, perhaps? He should be in a purely research role; not an administrator, not a teaching faculty member."
