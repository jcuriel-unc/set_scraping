1,5.0,2.0, PSYC245H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,"Professor Baucom is the best!! He truly cares about his students and does not grade difficultly. Only thing was that the class only had 4 assignments graded equally, but it was easy to get an A. "
2,5.0,3.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,"Dr. Baucom is an amazing professor! He is very caring and always strives to make his lectures as engaging as possible. He is very transparent which makes it easy for students to communicate with him. He truly wants you to learn and succeed in his class. The class is reading and somewhat lecture heavy, but it is so worth it! Would recommend!"
3,4.0,3.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,"Great prof, only downside is that he talks a ton so you'll have to watch videos after class often. Really did learn a lot, and this guy is wholesome. Chances are you'll like him too."
4,5.0,2.0, PSYC245H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,"Dr. Baucom was a great professor. Tests are straight-forward as long as you are paying attention in class and do all of the textbook reading. There was one term paper, but the topic was really interesting and Dr. Baucom provided great feedback."
5,5.0,3.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,Amazing professor! Lectures are super interesting and engaging. Tests are easy as long as you watch the videos and read the textbook (easy and fascinating readings). 10-page movie paper is easy and fun! Very accommodating during COVID. Grade is composed of the paper and 3 exams all weighted equally. No homework
6,5.0,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,"Dr. Baucom is awesome, intelligent, and cares about his students. I loved the class (abnormal psychology) and he was really accommodating through the pandemic. The final movie paper assignment was stressful but super interesting and he gave back great feedback! There are 3 exams and 1 paper (each worth 25% of the grade). Need to read the textbook"
7,5.0,3.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,"Dr. Baucom was a great professor. He made the content interesting, and he chose a good textbook to cover the content. You definitely should read the textbook since some parts of the exam are not covered in the lecture and only found in the reading. He was accommodating and engaging. The paper assigned is very interesting, based on films."
8,5.0,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,One of the loveliest human beings I know. Extremely knowledgeable and full of interesting anecdotes. The class is just exams and an essay -- no real homework. A fair and easy A if you try.
9,2.0,3.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,"I was excited to have a class with Baucom but this quickly turned into disappointment. Maybe had we had a normal semester this would not be so, but his lectures are pointless. also he is not accommodating AT ALL. everything has to be the way he says so, would not recommend him at all"
10,5.0,3.0, PSYC245H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,Dr. Baucom is easily the best professor I've ever had. He's brilliant in his field and he makes the information relatable and interesting. I actually looked forward to class each week. It's obvious he cares about his students and wants to engage with them. I wish he taught more undergraduate classes!
11,5.0,3.0, PSYC245H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,Absolutely fantastic professor. Interesting lectures full of real-world application/examples. Tests are very reasonable as long as you attend lectures and look through the book. Don't be put off by the 10 page paper - fascinating movie diagnosis project once you get into it. Only issue is he's not teaching every psych course.
12,5.0,3.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,"His lectures were super interesting and if you do have to miss class the powerpoints he teaches from are online. Reading the textbook helps if you want to do well in this class because there are 3 exams, including the final, worth 25% of your grade and a lot of the info comes from it. You do have to write a 10-page research paper (the other 25%)!"
13,5.0,3.0, PSYC245H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,"Dr. Baucom is amazing! He is a superstar in his field and totally cool. He loves to teach and I loved going to class and learning. The material is really interesting and he is a really fast grader who usually gets grades back the same day. 10/10 recommendation, not an easy A but attainable if you put in the work."
14,5.0,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,DONALD,BAUCOM,Was an astounding teacher. He was actively engaging and quite often had the class laughing or horribly embarrassed. He was personable when engaged one on one. Highly recommend taking him while at UNC.
