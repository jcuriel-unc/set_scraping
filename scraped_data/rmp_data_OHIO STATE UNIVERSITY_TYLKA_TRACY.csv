1,5.0,2.0, ABNORMALPSYCH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRACY,TYLKA,"A very kind professor. Lectures were interesting, as she didn't read off slides word for word and added insight from what she has learned, or personal experiences. A textbook was not necessary, but an option was given if you needed extra help. Would definitely take her classes again."

Her class was the highlight of my semester, and as long as you do your work and study, you'll do amazing in this class. I have never met such a well-respected, kind, and charismatic professor before! I truly wish her all the best. Thank you for everything, Dr. Tylka!"
4,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRACY,TYLKA,Dr. Tylka is an amazing professor. She definitely cares about your performance in class and will do almost anything to help you be better and understand more. I would 100% take her class again!
5,5.0,1.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRACY,TYLKA,"Show up and listen to what she says and you pass. Her review sheets are spot on with her exams. If you can answer the questions on the review sheets your golden, also her exams are very simple and easy to understand all you have to do is just study."
6,5.0,1.0, PSYCH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRACY,TYLKA,"Loved Dr. Tylka, she makes you work for your grade but provides plenty of feedback and help if you need it. Her lectures were intresting, she gives you full notes and has you fill in the blanks. She's a very nice person, I like her area of study. Enjoyed her class a lot! "
7,5.0,2.0, 3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRACY,TYLKA,"Dr. Tylka is absolutely one of the best professors I've ever had. Her expectations are clear, she's more than happy to help, and her experience in the field really shines through. She's a very sweet lady, too! I strongly recommend using the study guides that she provides."
8,4.5,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRACY,TYLKA,"Dr. Tylka is extremely nice and down to Earth. Her lectures are interesting, and she provides powerpoint notes for you to print and bring to class with you. She re-reads definitions three times, so you don't miss a thing. She doesn't over-complicate things either. She doesn't take attendance, but if you don't go to class you'll miss a lot. "
9,5.0,1.0, PSYCH4540,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRACY,TYLKA,Dr. Tylka is a very nice and laid back teacher. She explains things clearly and provides her power points online to take notes. Not too much from the textbook. She provides study guides for her tests so you know exactly what to expect on her tests. I recommend taking a class with Dr. Tylka.
10,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3530,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRACY,TYLKA,"I loved this class. I've taken a few classes with Dr. Tylka and I've enjoyed them all. She doesn't require that you come to class, but if you don't you will miss a lot, especially because we did not use a textbook. You can get an A in the class if you come to class, take the notes, and read over them."
