1,4.0,4.0, COMM4820,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"Chip is a cool dude, but his class is BORING. The class is mostly a discussion on readings and you must participate. There is no final which is nice but there is a quiz due before every class, and it's heavily based on the readings. And you only get 5 minutes on the quiz. Don't be surprised if you end up falling asleep during his lectures."
2,3.0,4.0, COMM4820,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"Chip is really kind, but he cares more about content then students. There is a quiz before every class and the Assignments take forever. If you are just taking this class to get an easy A, its not. you will work for it. The class was very thought provoking though."
3,5.0,3.0, COMM3440,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"Chip is a great professor, he makes the classroom a conversation more than just a lecture hall. The material he covers is great and really has you think about the world of media and communication. I learned a lot from him. Tests and assignments are a little hard but if you put in the time you will do well."
4,5.0,4.0, COMM3440,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"Chip is simply one of the best professors I had at OSU but his class is not for everyone. There is a lot of reading and technology use is frowned upon. But if you are interested in communication or politics, this is a must-take. A course that will truly change your worldview if you put in the effort. Don't skip class (random attendance sign-ups)."
5,4.0,4.0, COMM3440,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"Had Chip for Political Comm, never had him for a pre-req course. I loved his class though. Interesting, intense material. People think he's tough, but guess what: he treats his students like adults and wants to make class a discussion, not a lecture. Considerable reading and discussion to expect, but absolutely a get out what you put in course."
6,2.0,5.0, COMM3440,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"Do not take his classes. The class material could be incredibly easy to understand, and he tries to make it sound more complicated to suit his ego.  His tests are unnecessarily difficult and I feel like he does it on purpose. He doesn't get enough love from his department so he takes it out on the students. Stay away from him. "
7,1.0,4.0, 3440,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"""Chip"" may be the worst professor at Ohio State. He is so condescending and full of himself and made the class harder and more boring than it ever needed to be. I looked up his rating before I took the class and he seemed okay but trust me he is not. I hated every second I spent in this class and was beyond glad to see the last of him. "
8,5.0,1.0, 1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,He is funny! 
9,1.5,5.0, COMM1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"""Chip"" is resentful his research can't earn grants and takes it out on students by taking a entry level class full of athletes and people who are just trying to get into the major way to seriously. He makes things unnecessarily difficult and believes he is the ""cool"" teacher but is unhelpful and screws students over on exams and quizzes. Avoid him!"
10,3.5,4.0, COMM1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"Chip is great. He really understands theory, but his has a background political communications and often uses political examples for class. This could be helpful in a class with 600 students because everyone has a basic knowledge on political issues. He DOES NOT post lectures note online, so read the textbook & going to office hours &/or see a TA."
11,5.0,1.0, COMM1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"Chip is a really nice guy and knows how to explain the material and give good examples. He doesn't give out extra credit and there are only 3 exams, 10 quizzes and 5 CREP experiment points but the material is common sense and easy to grasp. He also gives you a chance to take everything a second time and get the average of your scores."
12,3.0,3.0, COMM1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,he took this class waaaay too seriously for a 100 level Comm class.  offers no extra credit and averages your exams and quizzes instead of taking your better score
13,1.5,4.0, COMM1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,there is NO opportunity for extra credit and the exam questions can be a little tricky. Make sure you read the questions in entirety. Chip is a good guy but You must come to class to get notes because he wont give them out for any reason. Make a friend in his class so you can give notes to each other. You have to have the book to pass quizzes.
14,3.5,3.0, COMM1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"Relatively easy. Need to attend class for notes. Need textbook for quizzes. Exams are somewhat harder than they need to be, but not impossible."
15,4.5,1.0, COMM1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,The questions on the exams are right from the power point notes. If you go to class or get the notes from someone it's an easy class. You also are allowed to take exams twice and average the scores. Overall he made the class interesting and I would take him again.
16,1.5,4.0, COMM1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"""Chip"" is pessimistic and not helpful when it comes to students individually. Lecture notes are ridiculous (grammar, length) and he doesn't have the ability to clarify. He puts most of his work on his TA's and will ramble during lecture- hard to focus. The class is too large for him to care.CERTAINLY made this course more difficult than needed"
17,5.0,2.0, COMM1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"He was a nice guy who explained the concepts really well and made the subject interesting.  His exams were straight forward from the material and were not trying to trick or mislead, just test your knowledge"
18,4.0,2.0, COMM1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,At first the class seems difficult but after the first text it's very predictable. The quizzes and exams are straight out of the textbook and notes. Make sure you go to class because he doesn't post his notes. Overall the class really isn't too bad.
19,5.0,2.0, COMM1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,He's really funny and makes lectures pretty interesting and fun which made me look forward to going to class. Very interactive with the students during class and clarifies the material better than the textbook does. The book is necessary for both the exams and online quizzes.
20,4.5,2.0, COMM1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,EVELAND,"He makes class pretty interesting. You don't need to attend because basically the same stuff is in the text book, but he makes it so easy to understand. He's very organized so taking notes is easy. Tests are simple as long as you reread notes and text."
