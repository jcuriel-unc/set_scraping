1,5.0,3.0, PSYC559,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,OSCAR,GONZALEZ,Dr. OG is an amazing professor and I recommend him 100000%. He is very passionate about his material and he also is very understanding and caring. 
2,3.0,3.0, PSYC559,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,OSCAR,GONZALEZ,"Oscar is an extremely nice human, but class is boring. You get just a week to do each lab, which is 10-15 pages of APA style writing. "
3,3.0,3.0, PSYC559,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,OSCAR,GONZALEZ,"Oscar gives great step-by-step explanations of the stats concepts behind labs. The class is super approachable as he gives sample code that is almost the same as what you need to do for the lab. My complaints are that there isn't enough active learning making it VERY DIFFICULT to stay awake during class, and each lab can get LONG (e.g. 13 pages)"
4,5.0,2.0, PSYC531,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,OSCAR,GONZALEZ,"Professor Gonzalez is great!! Learning how to use R sounds intimidating but he's super helpful and walks you step by step. Also he has a textbook on the syllabus, but it wasn't  necessary. He goes over everything in lecture and there are no exams. Pay attention to what he goes over in lecture and go back through his slides for help on assignments"
5,4.0,3.0, PSYC531,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,OSCAR,GONZALEZ,"Dr. Gonzalez is really nice, but his lectures are quite boring. There are no tests, but there is a group project all semester. The assignments aren't too bad, but they are time consuming. For the final, there was a final paper and a group presentation, in which both he graded super easy. "
6,4.0,3.0, PSYC531,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,OSCAR,GONZALEZ,Professor Gonzalez is both well-versed in psychometrics and incredibly sweet and caring. Wasn't looking forward to the class because it is stat heavy and ew math but he made it super interesting and easy to follow along with.
