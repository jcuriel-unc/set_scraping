1,5.0,3.0, 21256,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,IAN,GOSSETT,Other reviews are way too harsh. With Ian being a relatively new professor he did a good job. The lectures were interesting & he was always really funny. If you actually went to class & did the readings the course was very manageable. He also gave extra credit frequently. I had him for two classes & always enjoyed his lectures. One of my favorites.
2,1.0,4.0, 21256,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,IAN,GOSSETT,"I strongly recommend not taking a course with this professor. I'm currently writing this review while sitting in his class, which I just dropped after two days because I decided I can't spend the entire semester with this instructor. He is very rude and condescending in his delivery of the material. Do yourself a favor and take a different class. "
3,5.0,3.0, 21256,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,IAN,GOSSETT,"I feel like all the other reviews are kind of too harsh. For a new professor, he wan't that bad. He cared about us and wanted us to do well. There were a few papers and if you asked enough questions, you would understand. Kind of disorganized but will not a harsh grader. "
4,4.0,4.0, 21256,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,IAN,GOSSETT,Tough class and confusion around some expectations but with effort I did learn a lot.
5,1.0,4.0, 21256,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,IAN,GOSSETT,"The worst instructor I've ever had. Constantly left class wondering why this is the education I'm paying for. Constantly wasted class time. Never responded to emails. Unclear about every aspect of class (material, schedule, plan, grading, questions). Got mad/aggressive when we didn't understand things but expected us to respond perfectly.

6,1.0,5.0, 21256,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,IAN,GOSSETT,"Terrible professor that obviously does not care about his students. Seems like his entire class is created in one night. Everything is disjointed and never gives clear grading criteria (0 rubrics or guidelines), but expects students to respond perfectly to his assignments. Slow grader, terrible communication, seems confused about his own courses. "
7,1.0,5.0, 21256,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,IAN,GOSSETT,"The worst professor I have had in my 4 yrs of college. Will not give direct responses to questions, very unorganized PowerPoints, very unorganized plan for syllabus and assignments, gets angry at students when they don't respond the way he wants. Does NOT properly explain anything. leaves students feeling very confused. Do not take his classes"
8,1.0,5.0, 21256,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,IAN,GOSSETT,"He is the worst professor I have ever had. He literally doesn't answer your questions he just leads you on with more unanswered questions. He sucks at lecturing, he goes super fast and expects people to participate but yet makes you feel dumb when you don't give him the response he wants. 
"
9,1.0,4.0, 21256,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,IAN,GOSSETT,"Ian is probably the worst professor I've ever had. Clearly has absolutely no idea what he is doing and sits in class and reads out of the textbook. Doesn't answer emails even after being called out. Gets overly mad when students don't read the textbook, but he sits in lecture and directly reads out of it."
10,1.0,5.0, 21256,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,IAN,GOSSETT,DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!!!
