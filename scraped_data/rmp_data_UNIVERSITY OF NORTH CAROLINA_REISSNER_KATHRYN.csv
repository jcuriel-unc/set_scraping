1,5.0,3.0, NSCI490,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHRYN,REISSNER,"She really enjoys what she's teaching! Very approachable. 
She was quite accommodating and seemed like she cared about how we were doing. 
However, she takes forever to give back grades. 
Tests were not bad. Doesn't give a rubric for papers, kinda vague. "
2,5.0,4.0, NSCI320,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHRYN,REISSNER,"Dr. Reissner was one of my favorite professors at UNC. You could tell how passionate she was about the content of the class and it made lectures so exciting. NSCI320 in general was such an interesting class, and she made accomodations for every student and truly cared about our well-being throughout the semester. She wants everyone to succeed!"
3,5.0,4.0, NSCI320,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHRYN,REISSNER,"Dr. Reissner is one of the kindest professors I've ever had at UNC, esp. with COVID. Willing to extend guidelines and work with the class if everyone agrees that something doesn't feel fair. She does grade pretty strictly for the tests, and they're really difficult if you don't take good notes. Two small papers, one longer research paper."
