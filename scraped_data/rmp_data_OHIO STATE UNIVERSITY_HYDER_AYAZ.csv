1,4.0,3.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"I really don't understand the hate for Ayaz. This obviously isn't the most fun class, but it isn't hard either. Attendance is mandatory, but you pay to go to school here so just show up. He is happy to help with questions but can be a little hard to reach at times. The final isn't bad, there are no ""right"" answers so just back up your responses."
2,1.0,4.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"Dr. Hyder, along with the other head professor for this class, did not support students well throughout the semester. The class felt very disorganized. He was also not very accessible through e-mail or through direct messaging through the course."
3,1.0,4.0, PH5015,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"Do not take public health data analytics. It was unclear and unorganized, though it was made sure that attendance was taken every class. They assume everyone who takes this class knows R and has the background knowledge of a math major. Those who do not meet those criteria will struggle immensely, and you will not get help when you ask questions."
4,1.0,3.0, PHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"There are not enough characters to complain about how horrible this class was. Attendance every day, which forced you to sit through boring lectures when the slides are posted online anyways. Group projects are assigned by Dr. Hyder, and are groups of 10-11 people, which was impossible to coordinate. Grading is hard and instructions are vague."
5,3.0,3.0, PUBHLTH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"Dr. Hyder cares a lot about environmental health and it shows in lectures. Speaking of lectures, they are boring but you need to go for attendance. Quizzes are online and pretty easy but you better hope your group is responsive because mine sucked and I had to do a lot of the work for those four projects"
6,2.0,3.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"You can tell he is a caring and nice person, but this is one of the most unorganized courses I have taken. The lecture slides either have overwhelming amounts of information or barely anything other than key terms. Unclear criteria for the assignments and paper as well. Pretty easy to pass but not a great time."
7,2.0,4.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"Lecture and attendance are important because the slides seem super random. Although if you miss classes its not a big deal, you just wont get points. Didnt feel like I learned anything. Exam was easy but didnt feel it pertained to much of what we learned"
8,1.0,3.0, PUBH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"Horrible, very unorganized, tough grader, he's friendly, but I really wouldn't recommend him."
9,3.0,2.0, PUB3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"It is evident that Dr. Hyder has a really good heart and is very knowledgeable on the subject of environmental health, but he doesn't do a great job translating this knowledge in an understandable manner to his students. Don't let this scare you, because it's not hard to do well in the class, but beware that you probably wont learn much from him."
10,1.0,3.0, PBH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"Just Ridiculous, he makes his quizzes and tests based on things that aren't even discussed in the slides or lecture (???????). Everything about him and his class is so unorganized. I don't even know how or why OSU hired him. Just b/c someone has a Ph.D.. it doesn't mean they will be a good professor."
11,2.0,3.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,Not a hard class but insanely boring and unorganized.
12,3.0,2.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"He is not that great of a professor, but also not that bad of a professor, but his class is very easy if you attend and take notes, so do that and you're set."
13,3.0,3.0, PH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"He has gotten SO much better this first semester at Ohio State. Don't pay attention to his past reviews. No tests and no textbook. All quizzes are online and straightforward for the most part. The papers can be annoying but he will help you through them. Not hard to get an A, just attend class on TopHat days aka Fridays."
14,3.0,3.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"I'm going to be more lenient because I was in the first class he ever taught. He clearly knows a lot about the subject, but struggles to deliver lectures (at the end he got better about involving us. My biggest complaint is that he was not very responsive to family emergencies/has very strict due dates. He also didn't ever have office hours."
15,1.0,3.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"Wouldn't recommend taking this class with him. His lectures are boring and unclear. The papers are a large part of your grade, but are graded very arbitrarily. He's condescending  and rude when spoken to in person. Makes it clear he doesn't want students to succeed. I learned nothing from this class and am avoiding any future classes taught by him."
16,2.0,3.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"Class grade is based off of online quizzes over lecture material and two papers. The papers are very easy and graded generously, however the quizzes often included details from lecture that were barely mentioned making it difficult. He was extremely boring but the guest lecturers were much more interesting and provided more straight forward content"
17,1.0,3.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"Content has potential to be very interesting, but the lectures are very boring. About 1/4 of the class shows up to lecture each time. Quizzes often didn't make sense at all, but papers were graded generously."
18,3.0,3.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"This is his first semester teaching here. He is not as bad as the previous review. Need to take notes, slides are posted online but notes are needed to get decent grades on quizzes. No tests!"
19,1.0,4.0, PUBHEHES3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AYAZ,HYDER,"Failed quizzes from lectures given by him, and a's on those given by guest lecturers. The lectures make little sense and are supplemented by power points that are little help. Guest lecturers make up probably a little less than half of the classes. No tests, only quizzes and two papers."
