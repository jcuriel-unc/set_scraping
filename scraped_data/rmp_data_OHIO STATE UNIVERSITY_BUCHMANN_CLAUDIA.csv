1,4.0,2.0, SOC,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,"Great professor. Short papers to do sometimes; re-read them before turning them in. 

Only a little to do weekly. SHE OFFERS EXTRA CREDIT, TAKE IT. The class has very few points. Take advantage.

Go through lectures and readings for the weekly quizzes and discussion boards. It will help you out because the answers are always there!"
2,1.0,5.0, SOC,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,"If you can avoid professor Buchmann, DO IT. A ridiculous amount of work for no reason. Extremely harsh grader. I was literally.5% away from an A and she refused to offer anything. Which isn't the end of the world, but overall her class just feels like a bunch of busy work and like she takes off points just cause she feels like it. "
3,1.0,3.0, SOC3463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,Would not recommend taking this course. Very boring and graded harshly. Learned nothing
4,2.0,2.0, SOC3463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,"Grades pretty difficult and is a very petty grader. Makes assignments due on a Saturday instead of Sunday. Not the most difficult course, but is not a fun one. Most of the assigned work feels like busy work"
5,5.0,2.0, SOC3463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,Class is clear and easy to follow. Variety of material so it doesn't get boring. Quizzes aren't too difficult. Opportunities for extra credit. Would reccomend.
6,3.5,2.0, SOCIO463H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,"Very knowledgeable professor.  Assigns a lot of reading.  Papers and exams, especially, are graded strictly.  A great GEC overall.  Would recommend to a friend!"
7,5.0,4.0, SOC463H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,"This was absolutely my favorite class taken @ OSU so far.  She knows her stuff and I learned SO much from this class.  The midterm (for the Honors version of the class) was a take-home, which was better because it's a really subjective class, not an objective class.  I forgot to fill out my student evaluation for her, so I'm giving her an A+ on her"
8,4.0,4.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,"This is a fantastic class.  If you put in the time to do the readings, and pay attention in class, you'll succeed. 1 Quiz, Midterm, Final, 2 papers, and few other assignments.  Attendance is mandatory, but it really isn't that bad because you'll learn about interesting material and are really forced to think critically.  One of my favorite classes."
9,3.5,1.0, SOC597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,"She is a good teacher. Likes to talk a lot and gets everyone involved. She is a tough grader on her exams but easy with the papers. You have to do a ton of work in this class and must show interest or she won't give you the grade you deserve. She is fair, but if you don't like to read and write, avoid her class. Lots of discussions (10%) of grade."
10,1.5,4.0, SOC597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,I did not care for Professor Buchmann one bit. She didnt really seem to know what she was talking about. She was quite ditzy at times and laughed at the mistakes that she made often.She assigns too much reading for the amount of assignments she expects you to do.
11,4.0,4.0, SOC597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,Great Class. Fair teacher. Really cares that the students are understanding the lectures. Uses a lot of media and visual aides. Exams are combined of essay and mutiple choice. Her multiple choice questions are tricky. Essays are generally on the topics you spend a great deal talking about in class. Attendance is required. Study guides are used.
12,5.0,1.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,"This was my favorite course as a SOC major.  Her lectures are organized, easy to follow, and she makes great use of multimedia and visual aids.  You can get by on the exams without doing the reading...however the reading material is actually pretty interesting and dare I say...enjoyable. TAKE THIS COURSE!"
13,2.5,2.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,"attendance was mandatory but lectures were boring, the pace at which we covered material was slow.  Most of the exams espeacially the multiple choice questions on exams were over trivial statistics instead of overall ideas. I do not recommend this class for upper level sociology majors as nothing new will be covered, it seemed to be a broad review"
14,4.5,3.0, SOC364,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,"Love her! Very understanding, and helpful."
15,4.0,3.0, 463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,very ethusiastic about teaching
16,3.0,4.0, SOC480,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,The readings are very necessary and are on the exams. She is very picky with her grading. Her review sheets are very helpful. Study those and you're good to go.
17,1.0,3.0, SOC,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,No Comments
18,4.0,1.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,Easy as hell as long as you go to class. Reading isn't even neccessary.
19,5.0,1.0, SOC463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLAUDIA,BUCHMANN,"Class material is very easy and obvious.  A bit picky about grading on tests, but overall an easy course without much work."
