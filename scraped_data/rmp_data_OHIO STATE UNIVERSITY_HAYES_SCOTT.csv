1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SCOTT,HAYES,"COVID-19: His response to courses going virtual was amazing. All lectures were asynchronous, except group project meetings every few weeks. Instead of lectures, he made overview videos that summarized important points. Did a mid-class survey to check in with students and was willing to make changes. Plenty of opportunities for points via quizzes."
2,1.0,3.0, PSYCH4531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SCOTT,HAYES,The WORST psych professor I have ever had. The textbook is $200 & he refuses to post the slides. Gives you a week's worth of information every single class. Has the most unclear grading criteria & gives you a bad grade for not knowing what he wanted. Gave ONE paragraph of instructions on the huge semester long project. Avoid him if you can!
