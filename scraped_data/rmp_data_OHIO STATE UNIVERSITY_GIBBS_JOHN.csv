1,2.0,5.0, PSYCH4552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"He is a nice guy, don't get me wrong, but he needs to retire. His content is extremely outdated and lectures are a waste of time as you're only tested on bits of it. 95% of everything you need to know is in the textbook, which is hardly covered in class. He takes attendance only to see who is coming to class (he won't help you if you don't attend)."
2,1.0,4.0, PSYCH552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"Terrible. Avoid at all costs this class is basically self-taught. You have to read chapters from a textbook since the test is over all of it, but he spends each lecture on around 2 pages. Lecture is WORTHLESS and his lecture really just feel like an old man rambling on without clear idea of what he wants to get across. DO NOT TAKE IF U CAN"
3,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"Nice guy and all, but not great professor. The reason I gave three stars was because I love studying Adolescent Development (and did well before this class). Very very outdated material is taught. Also uses old school teaching styles, which is fine I guess but dont expect anything on carmen or really for him to use the internet. But he is caring."
4,2.0,3.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"Slides and information are very outdated and honestly, problematic. He cited a study that was used to promote conversion therapy, cited another study that claimed that gay adults feel unsatisfied with their life, and used the term transsexual in class. Very little of the material was published within the last 5 years. Information is useless today"
5,2.0,4.0, PSYCH5832,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"AVOID! (grad and undergrad). This class was incredibly frustrating. Read the book or you will not get above a C (that is as low as he goes at least). Lectures consisted of nothing but boosting his own ego & showing clips of ""moral exemplars"" and ""What Would You Do?"". Only grades are a paper, presentation, 3 exams, and ""discussion Qs"" NOT optional."
6,4.0,3.0, PSYCH5832,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"Obviously knows his stuff, he literally ""wrote the book"" on developmental morality. However, can be a bit vague and confusing at times, lecture slides do not give much info, and I had to rely on the textbook to really get the necessary information for the exams. Great genuine guy and solid professor"
7,5.0,1.0, PSYCH5832,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"Gibbs is a really great instructor. He really cares about his students and hes really accessible. The content is awesome if youre into developmental psych and its a really laid back upper level psych course since exams are straightforward, easy, and dont count for much of the grade. Highly recommend him if youre looking for an easy A."
8,4.0,2.0, PSYCH4305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,BE NICE TO DR. GIBBS we do NOT deserve him
9,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,He's a really nice guy. Really cares about what he is teaching and is always willing to help. I've grown to like Dr. Gibbs and am going to miss him after this semester. I'm not sure why people are so hard on him.
10,3.0,2.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"There were 3 exams, all multiple choice with 70 questions. Going to class and buying the book are pointless. All you have to do is go on quizlet and study the study questions from the powerpoint he post on Carmen. If you study those it is an easy A. Also does an extra credit book review which is optional."
11,3.0,2.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"Okay so the class is super easy if you have taken any basic psych classes before this. I literally tried with every thing in me to pay attention during lectures but they are excruciating. Only grades on 3 exams but has an extra credit paper option. Hes old and his class reflects old psychology methods, etc. Easy A if you dont mind boredom."
12,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"Lets just put it this way, hes old. Doesnt curve exams even if no one is getting perfects and no one got a perfect or even within 5 of a perfect on any of the exams. Would avoid him as a professor again or any class he teaches. Even my advisor sighed when I told her I had him lol."
13,2.0,3.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,Is not clear when trying to teach; teaches his own views and research instead of what is in the textbook; does not answer questions well; lectures are very boring but he shows a lot of videos; only graded on three tests including final but gives an extra credit book review that saved my grade; READ THE TEXTBOOK; gives study questions for tests
14,3.5,3.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"He is pretty long-winded, so lectures last the whole time. He has 3 exams which are based directly off his powerpoint and study questions during lectures. He takes attendance sometimes and will boost grades if you are a regular attendee. He is pretty understanding and if you miss a lecture, you can go to his office hours for a review of it."
15,2.0,3.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,He only has three exams and that is it. I liked how he gave us the questions but they were broad compared to the ones on the exams. His lectures were very boring.
16,1.5,3.0, PYSCH552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"Dr. Gibbs does not teach modern psychology. He teaches old psychology that is much more similar to armchair philosophy than modern, scientific psychology. For the love of everything holy, if you take a class from him do not believe that what you are learning is actually psychology!"
17,3.0,3.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"Lectures were boring, but he gives you study guide question which are helpful for the exams.  Definitely have to read the textbook to pass"
18,2.5,4.0, 4552,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,"Gibbs could be a hot mess. Usually wears a mic that is torn off his shirt every ten minutes because he continues to step on the cord. At least it's a bit of a shock to wake you up from his boring lectures!!  Big mumbler; No need to attend class. Read book, fill out the study guide and you'll do just fine."
19,1.0,4.0, 3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,Was super boring but somehow got away with an A by reading the book the week before the exam. Don't need to attend class.. there were no participation points given just taken if you need an extra bump at the end of the class. Could've literally fallen asleep in his class 
20,1.0,3.0, 3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,GIBBS,Don't know how its possible but he never actually taught. He talked about what he was going to talk about for 90 minutes!  must read the textbook in order to fill out the study guides. Only ever went to class to get the participation points. extra credit was amazing! reading a book and writing a review can bring your grade from a B+ to an A- exc.
