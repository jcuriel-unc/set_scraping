She genuinely cares about her students and is very knowledgeable about what she teaches. I have definitely learned more in this class than any other class I have taken and enjoyed it thoroughly. Lots of work, an A takes a lot of effort, but a fantastic class."
2,5.0,3.0, PUB4650,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TASLEEM,PADAMSEE,"Dr. Padamsee was an incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and passionate professor. This class requires some effort, but she explains the content in a thorough and understandable manner, but will readily reiterate confusing information if necessary. She truly, truly cares about her students and is doing some incredible research outside of the classroom!"

She's great but I can't find anything interesting about Medicaid, Medicare, etc. And it was also the hardest course I've taken at OSU. Dont skip class. Attendance is important. Pay attention to guest lectures on exams."
4,5.0,3.0, PUBHHMP4650,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TASLEEM,PADAMSEE,"This was my favorite class taken so far - the information is useful outside of the course and Prof. Padamsee was very engaging and encouraged discussions in class. However, watch out for the group paper/video at the end. Groups are assigned and it is a lot more work than it may seem!"
5,5.0,3.0, PUBHHMP4650,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TASLEEM,PADAMSEE,"In all honesty, the content for this class can be boring especially in an 1 hour 20 minute lecture. But I must say, Dr. Padamsee took the time to help me not only with coursework but with life issues. She cares about her students and her role at Ohio State. I will forever be thankful for Dr. Padamsee and recommend her if you have the option."
