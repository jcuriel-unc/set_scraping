1,1.0,5.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARILYNN,BREWER,she was horrible! during office hours she made her students feel stupid for asking questions. isn't that what office hours are for? she thinks she's better than everyone and gives you a bad grade if you can't read her mind. DO NOT take class with her. i always get A's in psych... it's my major.I got a C in her class!
2,1.0,4.0, PSYCHSECT,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARILYNN,BREWER,One of the worst professors I have ever had. I do not doubt she is intelligent however her job is to teach... and at this I give her an F. She seems arrogant and god forbid you miss a class... she is not helpful. I found her rather rude.DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER.
3,3.0,5.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARILYNN,BREWER,"Never know what is going to be on exams - there have been times I've tried to look up questions after the test and either couldn't find them at all in the lecture notes or text, or they came from chapters not even covered yet.. Also a rather rude/superior attitude.."
4,4.0,2.0, PSY375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARILYNN,BREWER,Most of what you need to know is in the notes.  Maybe 1 or 2 questions on the exams from the book. Brilliant women who loves her work...but not a great public speaker.
5,3.5,2.0, PSYCH375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARILYNN,BREWER,"Pretty easy class, just had 3 tests and 2 small assignments.  The textbooks aren't too dull.  Just come to class and pay attention, and skim the books, and you should be fine."
