1,5.0,1.0, POLI204,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Great professor! He was really engaging, encouraged good class discussions, and was open to all students' ideas. Poli 204 was pretty easy when I took it - he gave us study guides for the exams and you can probably get by without doing all of the reading. Class attendance matters, so if you skip you're grade will be impacted."
2,5.0,2.0, POLI204,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Dr. Clark is one of my favorite professors at UNC. He is clearly extremely interested in politics and, will often go on tangents in class. A lot of his tangents are really entertaining, though, which make his lectures really easy to pay attention to, with him encouraging lots of participation. His lecture slides are easy to reproduce and useful."
3,5.0,3.0, POLI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Take classes with Dr. Clark! He is clearly passionate about the topic and encourages class discussion, which is super interesting. As of fall 2022, there are a lot of readings in this class and your grade is based off of a few assignments, but it is manageable. Not sure if that'll be changed up in the future. Nonetheless, great class."
4,5.0,3.0, POLI204,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Loved Dr. Clark! Lectures are interesting and engaging. Lots of class discussion. Only downsides are that he sometimes rambles and that the class is graded off 2 essays and 2 tests. However, you will learn a lot from the class and the classroom is very engaging and respectful. I would totally take him again!"
5,5.0,3.0, POLI76,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,TAKE THIS CLASS!
6,5.0,3.0, POLI76,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Your grade consists of a midterm, 2 papers, a group presentation, and participation. Prof. Clark is a fair grader for all of those assignments, and is always clear with his expectations. He's clearly invested in what he teaches, which always makes his lectures interesting to listen to. Take this FYS if you have the chance!"
7,5.0,3.0, POLI76,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Dr. Clark is definitely one of my favorite professors at UNC. He is very passionate about what he teaches and encourages students to participate. His class consisted of readings, 2 papers, a midterm and a final group project. If you are interested in learning about the topics he teaches I would definitely recommend taking a class from him. "
8,5.0,1.0, POLI76,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,Professor Clark has been my favorite professor so far at UNC. His lectures are engaging and he clearly cares about what he teaches. If you are passionate about the topic of the class then you will surely enjoy taking his classes. He goes out of his way to create an inclusive class environment for all students.
9,5.0,2.0, POLI205,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,I would 100% take Dr. Clark again. He was able to distill difficult information to us in manageable terms. His tests were not too difficult if you watched the lectures. You do not need to read the textbook to get a good grade either.
10,5.0,3.0, POLI204,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"This was my second class with him, and I loved it! I learned a lot of useful information about Southern politics, and you can tell he loves what he does. He is an engaging lecturer, gives good feedback on papers, and his exams are straightforward. Definitely take him if you have the chance."
11,4.0,2.0, POLI76,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Super awesome guy and extremely knowledgeable, but he was slow to grade and we never got lectures on time, which was stressful for the COVID semester. Still a king tho and I would definitely recommend if the class is in person"
12,4.0,3.0, POLI204,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Dr. Clark is kind and cares about what he teaches, but this class was not enjoyable online. Class was asynchronous, and he sent out lectures SEVERAL days after the day we should have had them. The 2 papers were difficult but the midterm and final were easy! This class was not a lot of work, but I'm not sure if I'd take a class with him again."
13,4.0,4.0, POLI205,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Dr. Clark is a solid professor! I learned a lot from him and you can tell he is really passionate about the material. He is easily distracted which means his lectures can be a bit convoluted, but I didn't really mind. His class is definitely not an ""easy A"" because the exams are pretty tough, but the papers and projects help make up for that."
14,4.0,3.0, POLI76,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,Clark is so enthusiastic abt his subject and is great at explaining the material even in the asynchronic format. There's A LOT of reading for POLI76 so be prepared but tbh u can skim and as long as u watch lecture u'll get the main points. Not a super harsh grader and there are few assignments other than reading/lecture. 2 papers and 1 group proj.
15,5.0,2.0, POLI422,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Great professor. His clear enthusiasm and interest in the topic made me really want to learn. Do your readings, take notes in class, and spend time thinking about the issues and topics this class discusses: you'll do well. Funny guy as well."
16,5.0,3.0, POLI205,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Loved having him as a professor this semester! I definitely plan on taking a class with him again. This class isn't necessarily an easy A, as the second midterm and final are pretty difficult. Attendance is taken occasionally, but info directly from lectures is on tests. He is very passionate and makes boring subjects more relevant an interesting!"
17,4.0,1.0, POLI205,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"Dr. Clark shows that a class doesnt need to be insanely hard for you to learn a lot from it. The tests are very consistent with the lectures/readings, and you get to spend a lot of time on discussions and current events. It can get a little dry/awkward if no one is participating, but hes very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what he teaches."
18,5.0,2.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,Dr. Clark is awesome! One of my favorite professors at UNC. He is hilarious and genuinely cares about his students and is passionate about the class material. He also makes lectures interesting.
19,5.0,2.0, POLI205,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,Clark is one of my favorite professors i've had at UNC. His exams come straight from lecture material so I recommend going to class. Also takes attendance once in a while. A fair grader & made lectures enjoyable! can tell he is passionate about politics & a super nice guy!
20,5.0,4.0, POLI204,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHRISTOPHER,CLARK,"My favorite professor at UNC. Absolutely incredible lecturer. I had Dr. Clark for 101 and 204, and thoroughly enjoyed both of them. The grades I received in both classes were not ideal, but that was not necessarily because of him. He's a fair grader and knows how to explain what he's thinking. He's so funny and I never felt nervous in class."
