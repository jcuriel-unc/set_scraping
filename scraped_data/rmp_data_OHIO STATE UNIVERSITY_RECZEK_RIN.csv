2,4.5,3.0, SOCIOL1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RIN,RECZEK,"This class was engaging and interesting, and Dr. Reczek is very accessible and passionate about sociology. Her grading is extremely fair, and she created a fun classroom atmosphere and listened to students.  She'll push you to expand on your answers, but she's receptive to different perspectives."
