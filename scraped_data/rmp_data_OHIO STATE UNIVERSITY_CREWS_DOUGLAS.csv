1,5.0,3.0, ANTH5642,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,Great professor. He is the type that doesn't care for deadlines as he genuinely cares for students and worries more about whether we understood the material. He isn't big on exams as we just had papers in class which was weekly. This class was seminar style so attendance and participation matters. great conversations and overall great class. 
2,5.0,4.0, ANTH5645,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,Best professor I have had in my 3 years at Ohio State. He's such a caring person who wants his students to succeed and learn the material. Lots of papers for this course but all worth it.
3,5.0,1.0, ANTHROP2200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,Great class for science GE. Douglas Crews is a great professor that makes the class manageable and enjoyable. Just show up for the labs and the biweekly quizzes are not hard at all if you use his lecture slides.
4,5.0,1.0, ANTHRO2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"I would definitely take another class with Crews. The material is pretty straightforward & interesting, plus the labs are easy. Its clear that he cares a lot about his students too; he made a point to get to know everyone in the class, and he was always understanding when people missed things for valid reasons. One of the best professors Ive had!"
5,5.0,1.0, ANTHRO2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"Dr. Crews is an amazing professor. Hes very laid back and funny. His labs are easy, but his course is very lecture-heavy and his tests are difficult to study for (study guides are not clear nor helpful). He has you write a 1 page paper over a scientific article every other week or so, but he grades easy and is very understanding."
6,2.0,2.0, ANTHRO2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"I literally learned nothing in this class and would not recommend it. You can probably pick a class thats easy and youll actually learn in. Took a post test (not for a grade) at the end and knew as much as when I started. But, hes nice guy and labs are extremely easy. Weeklyish write ups on interesting articles are graded for completion."
7,5.0,3.0, ANTHRO2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,Professor Crews is a great professor. He is super chill if you get to know him. The labs are pretty quick. Exams are not too difficult. Engage in the class and you'll do well.
8,5.0,3.0, ANTHRO2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"Professor Crews was by far my favorite professor this semester! He is a genuinely good person and cares about his students. He gives BIG study guides and not everything on them is on the test, but if you pay attention and do a bit of studying you will get an A. His weekly article readings are actually really interesting!"
9,5.0,3.0, ANTHRO2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"Doug has been my favorite professor at OSU so far. He really cares a lot about his students and makes the effort to engage everyone. He goes through slides very quickly and the tests sometimes have pretty specific questions, but if you go to all the labs/classes, take good notes, study, and ask questions during the tests it's not hard to get an A!"
10,4.0,2.0, ANTHRO2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"Professor Crews is a great guy who always tried to make class enjoyable. He recognized that none of the people in my class were Anthropology majors, and he didnt pretend like the subjects were the most interesting thing in the world. The class was very boring, and the study guides were not very helpful when it came to the 3 exams. Awesome guy!"
11,4.0,3.0, ANTHRO2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"Lectures could get confusing, but if you put in the work he won't let you get a bad grade. Dr. Crews was funny and told a lot a great stories about field work. The grade was basically based on 3 midterms, but they were all curved, and he rounded up our grades if we attended class. Good GE choice for a bio science with a lab!"
12,1.0,3.0, ANTH640,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,Check out his CV. He is great at self-promotion. If you deal with him you will find out at some point that he is really only interested in himself. He does very little fieldwork or lab work but he gets all the publications. He lets other folks do the work and he gets the credit. That's how it works. Enjoy.
13,3.0,3.0, ANTHRO2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"The lectures aren't bad, and he likes to tell interesting stories of field work. Unfortunately, none of the lecture slides are online so you have to write everything down. The grades are almost completely from the three tests and those aren't too bad, but the study guides have too much on them that aren't even on the tests."
14,1.0,4.0, ANTHR3301,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,You must have a strong biology background to understand this class. I spend most of every class very very confused about what's happening because he expects you to have a ton of prior knowledge. He moves through things very fast and is very unclear.
15,4.0,2.0, ANTHRO2200H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"Pretty straightforward. His study guides aren't 100% of what's going to be on the test, though, so watch out. Labs and projects are all easy - just do them! The tests are kind of hit-or-miss, so study for them. Definitely doable."
16,2.0,4.0, ANTHRO3301,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"Worst professor I've experience thus far. Unhelpful, condescending, and worst of all, he based his class on 3 exams. After taking the exams, I felt I couldn't have studied any more in order to understand the material, simply because he figures that we should already know half of the material from other classes! Terrible. Just...don't do it."
17,3.0,2.0, ANTHR3301,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"If you come to class and pay attention, there is no way you shouldn't get an A even with minimal studying for exams. Easy class, but will be easier the more science knowledge you have. However he isn't the best in the hard science areas and at times he generalizes way too much and gets it wrong, the longer the explanation the more likely its wrong."
18,5.0,3.0, ANTHR301,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"Really good teacher.  Just come to class and take notes.  EVERYTHING that will be on the test will be in his power points! Since he doesn't put his p.p. online, you have to come to class to get the notes.  Plus he explains things as he goes so just go to class!!  He can go a little quickly through the p.p. so just speak up and he will go back."
19,1.5,5.0, ANTHR301,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,"Crews is a very poor and unclear professor, his lecture slides are terrible, he jumps around way too much and his exams are unfairly hard.  If you are not a science major with a strong genetics background run and hide, this class is waaaayyyy too hard for a GEC and I have a 3.9 in my honors major."
20,1.0,5.0, ANTH1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,CREWS,What is Cultural Marxisim Douglas Crews? Do you think you can answer that without changing the subject or direction? Don't get philosophical on my butt!
