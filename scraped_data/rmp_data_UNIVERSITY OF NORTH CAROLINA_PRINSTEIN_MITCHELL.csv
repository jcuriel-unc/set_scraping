1,5.0,2.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,"I would recommend taking psyc 180 with him! The class was super insightful and interesting. He understands the stress of school and tries to be as accommodating as possible. He also allows you to talk about life if you need to. He's a good lecturer and explained material very well. 4 papers total but they were simple, easy, and interesting."
2,5.0,1.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,Dr. Prinstein is hands down the most caring prof I've ever had. I would take any class I can with him. He was gracious and really listened to his students and this class was genuinely so interesting. It was the most enjoyable class I have taken and was more about learning/discussing than handing out grades/work.
3,5.0,3.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,"My favorite professor so far! Mitch is so nice, and he really cares about his students. The class was easy, as long as you go to class and watch the videos on knowmia. Relatively easy A especially if youre interested in psych. There were 3-4 papers that were actually interesting to write. 10/10 would recommend!"
4,5.0,3.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,"Mitch always made a point to accommodate to his students and the crazy semester we had. We had 4 papers, a midterm, and final. If you watch the lectures, participate in class, and do some readings ur good. The best part is everything we learn relates so much to our lives that you cant help but be interested."
5,5.0,2.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,"By far the best professor I've ever had. Class was interesting and it revolved around the students and our personal experiences. He understood the difficulties we were all facing amidst covid and online learning, and was extremely accommodating to every circumstance. It was a large lecture but he was always accessible. great class and prof"
6,5.0,2.0, PSYC180,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,"How interesting the class is depends on how much you care about the subject, but Mitch is great no matter what he's teaching. He's very engaging and enthusiastic; he's been very understanding and flexible with the pandemic too. PSYC 180 is a newer class, so be patient while they work out the bugs. If you grasp the general concepts then you're fine."
7,5.0,2.0, PSYC512,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,Mitch is passionate about his work and wants to help all students succeed.  Midterm and final is graded fairly as long as you can demonstrate that you understand the material taught.  Always willing to meet and talk about the class/paper/etc.  Would recommend his classes!
8,5.0,2.0, PSYC512,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,"Amazing. Mitch is fun, friendly, and brilliant. This class is pretty easy. Try to get into his lab if you want research experience. He's an incredible mentor."
9,5.0,1.0, PSYC512,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,"Easy class. Got boring sometimes, but he kept it pretty interesting. Very engaging lecturer. I would recommend him for this class"
10,5.0,1.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,"Prinstein was great. I think stat is really, really boring, but he actually made it interesting. The tests and assignments were not hard at all, and he's a funny guy who really cares about his students. Fantastic professor, fantastic class."
11,3.5,2.0, PSYC112,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,"Funny guy who keeps a potentially boring class interesting. The class is pretty easy if you've had any stats before. Lab is useless, but tolerable. He is really interested in teaching and knows a lot about the subject, seems very willing to help out students; he's on your side (if that makes any sense)."
12,2.5,2.0, PSYCH98,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,"Having only had him for independent study work, I must say that he is a nice professor, but is quite disorganized.  Make sure you spell out exactly what your questions are, and be certain that there is a clear agreement in what is expected."
13,5.0,2.0, PSYC155,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,Has a real interest in the subject.  Very engaging teacher which could make any class fun to be in.
14,5.0,3.0, PSYC30,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MITCHELL,PRINSTEIN,Funniest teacher ever! Made a really crappy class fun (or at least not torture... I hate math)
