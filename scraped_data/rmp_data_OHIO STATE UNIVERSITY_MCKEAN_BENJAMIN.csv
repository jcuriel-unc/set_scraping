1,5.0,3.0, POLISCI2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENJAMIN,MCKEAN,"Mckean is excellent, he really cares about his students, and is funny in class. I wasn't the biggest fan of the class, but that is not fault of his -- he is very accommodating and his grading rubrics are pretty clear for both papers and exams. Lots of reading, but he does a great job clarifying confusing readings. A fairly easy A given the work."
2,5.0,3.0, PS3460,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENJAMIN,MCKEAN,"Ben is an absolutely amazing professor. He cares about his students SO much and is incredibly understanding of mental health. This class has a lot of readings, but you can get away with skimming them as long as you pay attention to his lectures."
3,4.0,3.0, PS3460,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENJAMIN,MCKEAN,This guy is great just like what other comments said. The problem is that this class was assigned with some really bad TAs who don't give a damn. They are some extremely tough graders and they don't care for giving you good feedback. They don't even grade things until those assignments they are 3 weeks old. Absolute jerks.
4,5.0,4.0, PS5414,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENJAMIN,MCKEAN,"Great class! A lot of reading, but it's worth it if you are interested in political theory. Assignment feedback was very helpful, especially on papers. He made a graduate level class accessible to all of the students who took it (including undergrads and Program 60 students). Very understanding about his students' pandemic-related struggles, too."
5,5.0,3.0, PS2400H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENJAMIN,MCKEAN,"I love him *so* much! Ben is so nice and funny and helpful. I had a blast in his class and he is so smart. Yeah, you might not get As on all the papers, but there are more than enough points to make up for it. Lots of extra credit too, makes up for the pop quizzes (drops the worst ones). Honestly such a cool dude. Love him, wish it was my major."
6,5.0,3.0, IS2800,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENJAMIN,MCKEAN,"Though he presents information in odd orders, Benjamin McKean was an amazing professor to have for Intro to Peace Studies. He is very thorough in his lectures, and he actually inquires students on their thoughts on theories, and he makes an effort to understand their opinions. He gives you the final questions before the exam as well."
7,4.5,3.0, INTSTDS2800,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENJAMIN,MCKEAN,"McKean is really great, he knows a crazy amount about what he teaches. Also just generally, the class let's you see a lot of things in a new light, things you might be tuned out to (green movement, sweatshop workers). Also, if you don't do the reading or didn't understand it, he makes it very clear in class what the major takeaways are."
8,3.0,3.0, 4414,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENJAMIN,MCKEAN,"If you're a conservative you will have to put your views to the side and adapt a liberal mindset. You can't challenge the authors views. The readings are not only long, but tough to understand at times. participation is a part of grade(which are reading questions you submit for each class). (2) 1500 word papers and Final exam. Easy to get a B."
9,4.5,4.0, PS3460,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENJAMIN,MCKEAN,"Ben is a tough grader, but he is very inspiring and compelling. Of the classes I've had thus far, he is definitely the best professor that I have had. There is a ton of reading for the class, but usually the information was decently interesting. You will learn a lot if you just put forth the effort. "
10,5.0,3.0, PS2400H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENJAMIN,MCKEAN,"This was probably the best college course I've ever taken; very interesting, lots of new ideas, great teacher. The reading is tough, but he's forgiving on grading IMO. If you do the reading and make an honest effort on the essays you will get a good grade."
11,5.0,4.0, 2400H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,BENJAMIN,MCKEAN,"One of the best professors I've had. Extremely passionate, extremely helpful. Very globally aware and fun to talk to in general. If you're interested in PS, you will love his class. That being said, he grades somewhat difficult but you will learn a LOT. Put in the work and you will be fine. Don't skip class, participate, and READ THE TEXTS."
