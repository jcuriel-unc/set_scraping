1,5.0,4.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,Ryan was very engaging. He loved when the class would participate. We would sit & debate about real court cases and he always had good feedback.. I would've got a better grade if i read the textbook more. Exams definitely test your ability of applying what you know. DEFINITELY go to class. If you miss class you might get really lost. TAKE NOTES!
2,5.0,3.0, SOCIOLOGY2903,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,Professor Ryan is Amazing. He knows the material very well. And he is a very good looking man.
3,4.0,2.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,"Easy to pass, easy materials, and caring professor. Just remember to take some notes during lectures so that you can understand the material because not every single thing on exam is on the slides provided. He also gives general extra credit so don't worry about getting an A if you pay attention in his class."
4,4.0,2.0, SOCIO2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,"I really enjoyed Ryan's class. Some of his exams questions are tricky but if you study the study guide he gives and pay attention in class, you should be fine. Lots of discussion during his lectures which was nice. I learned a lot in this class."
5,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,"Ryan was a great professor. The class was very interesting and covered a wide range of topics surrounding law and its implications on society. Exams are very straightforward, and frequently in lectures, he will point to things that will be on the exam. Discussion is an excellent part of the class because everyone is allowed to have their opinion."
6,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,Fantastic lectures filled with debates over cases and decisions surrounding law. He is a great guy. Would recommend if you are at all interested in law and or an easy A.
7,5.0,3.0, SOC2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,Easily one of the best profs Ive had! Class is lecture based and exams are easy as long as you study the lecture slides! Recommend taking one of Ryans classes for sure!
8,5.0,2.0, SOC2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,"Good prof, most lectures are discussion based which keeps things interesting. Participation does not matter though which makes it nice. Exams aren't hard as long as you study the lecture slides."
9,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,One of the best professors Ive had. Super funny and relatable and makes the material interesting. Exams arent hard and readings are pretty interesting. I wish I had him for every class! I wouldnt want to skip class even if attendance wasnt mandatory.
10,5.0,2.0, SOCIO2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,"Ryan is an awesome prof. Many of the classes were just class discussions based on topics like affirmative action, juries, eyewitness testimonies, etc. Very funny and, if you actually show up to lecture, the tests are extremely straight forward. Posts slides on Carmen, but they don't have much info so you have to go to lecture, but he makes them fun"
11,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL4615,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,"Dr. King, one of the two best professors in the Soc and Crim department at OSU, guaranteed. Engaging, original lecture content. You do need to keep up with the weekly Carmen readings, but no textbook. Easy to go to class because the lectures are interesting. And Dr. King is H O T!!!!"
12,4.0,3.0, SOC2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,"Great teacher. Your grade is made up my 1 quiz, 1 paper, and 3 exams. The final is not cumulative. Gives study guide for the exams and its all straight from the notes he gives on powerpoint. Pretty easy class and makes it interesting."
13,5.0,1.0, SOC4615,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,"What a fantastic teacher.  I love his class. Easy to talk too, laid back class and clear grading criteria. Many people stayed after class each time just to learn more from him. Tests are off the review guide and paper is straight forward. Take him if you can!"
14,5.0,2.0, SOC4615,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,"Took this after changing my major into Soc. and this class made me more sure of my decision.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the lectures I came to, he was focused, informative, and very engaging.  I just missed out on an A because of a poor participation grade on in class writings . Tests were very straightforward as well.  Wish he taught more undergrad"
15,4.5,3.0, SOCIOL4615,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,"Ryan is my favorite professor I have had at the college level. I've taken him for Crime Control & Prevention as well as Intro to Law. He is a cool, smooth guy that makes lectures enjoyable. Good sense of humor and he knows his stuff. I would highly recommend Ryan to anyone. This university needs more professors like him."
16,5.0,2.0, SOC4615,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RYAN,KING,"Professor King has been one of my favorite professors at Ohio State so far. He makes the class really enjoyable and he is funny. He relates everything back to the real world with stories from his life and if not can think of something everyone can relate to. Makes sure you know what is on the exam, there is no guessing. Take his classes!"
