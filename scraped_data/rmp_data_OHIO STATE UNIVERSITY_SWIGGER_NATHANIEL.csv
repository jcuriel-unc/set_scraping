1,2.0,5.0, 2150,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NATHANIEL,SWIGGER,The classwork was alright but I will never take this professor again due to his stringent grading tendencies. I am a Dean's List student but this is the only class that I have struggled to obtain a B in. This class is not worth the stress and I would recommend selecting an alternative class or professor due to his heavy courseload and expectations
2,5.0,2.0, 2150,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NATHANIEL,SWIGGER,"Only 2 papers in the class and a final exam, however there are a lot of readings that are referred to in class and in the final. Lecture tends to be lengthy but interesting and entertaining at times. Prof. Swigger is quite knowledgeable in his field and can convey concepts in an understandable way."
