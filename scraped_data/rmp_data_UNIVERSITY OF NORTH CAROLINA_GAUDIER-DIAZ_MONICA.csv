1,5.0,3.0, NEURO175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Professor Gaudier-Diaz was the best professor I had my entire first year at UNC. While the readings assigned for the class are dense and hard to process sometimes, she does a spectacular job of making clear what she wants you to know in lectures. 
Also -- attendance isn't mandatory, but it made all the difference in keeping my grade high. Show up!"
2,4.0,4.0, NSCI439,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Dr. Gaudier-Diaz's lectures were interesting and I thought her projects really enhanced my learning. My only complaint with her lectures is you have to write absolutely everything down because her quizzes tend to be quite difficult. However, she is easily approachable and always willing to answer questions. "
3,5.0,4.0, NSCI439,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"It's an upper-level NSCI class, so it's going to be difficult. But it's so interesting! And Dr. Gaudier-Diaz really makes the tough readings so much more understandable during lectures. There are lots of components to the class, but she gives you frequent reminders."
4,4.0,2.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"It wasn't the easiest material but as long as you go to the lectures and turn in the small assignments, you will be fine. She isn't there to make the class harder. There are 3 writing assignments over the semester and a quiz before each class that is easy to do after reading. She has a lot of extra credit and all exams are take home/online."
5,1.0,5.0, NSCI439,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,Her class was much more difficult than it needed to be - it took an interesting topic and turned it into a painful/stressful topic. Her grading criteria is never clear. Her quizzes/exams are very hard and lecture notes only help with about 50% of the questions. She is not too receptive to feedback and makes you feel small. 
6,1.0,4.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"I wouldn't recommend taking a summer class with her. She rarely responds, her exams are so hard, and the amount of work for a 100 level course is a lot. She doesn't work with you much at all either, especially with summer conflicts."
7,4.0,4.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Flipped classroom style, so if that's not for you, steer clear. Readings are dense but you can kind of go off lecture slides and find YT videos to explain material better than textbook would. Consists of 2 reading quizzes a week, class participation, 1 group project, 3 writing assignments, 3 tests, some other activities, and a final. "
8,5.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Don't get me wrong, this class is challenging, and there is a lot of material to cover, but Dr. Gaudier-Diaz is very clear about what to know and what she expects of you. She is really nice, clearly loves the subject, and is passionate about making the class structure around student feedback. "
9,5.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Dr. Gaudier-Diaz is fantastic. Her class does require a lot of reading, and each reading is important, but the readings are not difficult to comprehend. She is clear with what she wants, and she provides cushion for grading. She's very nice, and really cares about the material. I would 100% take her class again. "
10,2.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"spare your sanity and never take a summer class with her. prof was very disorganized, hard to get ahold of, and less than helpful. the work is not hard but the lecture videos don't cover pretty much anything on the exams. prof has been impossible to get in contact with when there is confusion--and there's a lot of it. would not recommend. "
11,4.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Dr. GD is fantastic! She doesn't place all the emphasis on exams, which is extremely helpful. There's a lot of reading, but I really only focused on her lectures for exams. The assignments she gives are sometimes time-consuming, but the grading is lenient."
12,3.0,2.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Prof. Gaudier-Diaz is nice and offers easy extra credit along with lots of participation points, exams are all open note, only three writing assignments throughout the semester. Reading outside of class is definitely necessary because her lectures move fast and she tends to get rushed towards the end and skip over topics that could be on the exam."
13,3.0,2.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"my best tip to do well on exams is to take the lesson objectives (which the exams are based on) and organize everything that applies to them from book and lecture notes into a study guide after covering each chapter(aka after every class). try to do this as you go along instead of before the exam, helped me tremendously. also so much reading  "
14,4.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Dr. Gaudier-Diaz is a great and caring teacher! You do have to read a good chunk of a dense textbook before every class, but she would explain concepts in a very understandable way. At times, the lecture slides were a bit disorganized. The concept maps, group project, writing assignments, and three midterms all had fair grading criteria. "
15,3.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Not a bad Professor by any means, but her contributions to your learning are pretty limited, as she essentially just reiterates textbook reading through slideshows. She is knowledgeable about the subject however and has a kind tone in her lectures. If you study, the tests are not bad, and the quizzes come straight from the textbook (dense reading)."
16,5.0,4.0, NSCI439,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Dr. Gaudier was great for this course. She studies the content through her research so you can tell she is very passionate. Lectures are not recorded, so you must come to class. There is no textbook so you have to make sure you listen word for word what she says during lecture. Fair quizzes and there are many projects/papers that are graded fairly!"
17,5.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,I loved her lectures and the structure of the class. You do have to do the textbook readings to get a good understanding of the material but all of the assignments and projects were really easy and fun to do. I learned a ton.
18,3.0,5.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Dear God these readings will be the death of me. Literally dont do them, its a waste of time and wont leave u with enough time to actually STUDY for exams. Just take notes off the ppt. Monica is nice enough and she certainly knows her stuff. She also offers lots of office hours. The material is just dense"
19,4.0,5.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"Professor Gaudier-Diaz had a very structured class which was helpful. She is caring and is there for her students. The reading is extremely dense and there is A LOT of it. Personally, the structure was not the most beneficial for me but I admire her organization. She has clear expectations and guides to her exams. Great professor for being so new!"
20,5.0,3.0, NSCI175,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,MONICA,GAUDIER-DIAZ,"She is very sweet, supportive, and accommodating. Don't worry if you do not have a strong NSCI background coming into class. Even though there's lots of readings, use the supplemental videos/other resources! The two-minute neuroscience videos on YouTube are also very helpful! She explains concepts very well in at review sessions and office hours."
