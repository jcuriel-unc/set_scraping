1,5.0,1.0, POL1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"There was a lot of reading but it was not necessary. Could retake most quizzes an unlimited number of times. Directions for papers were sometimes unclear, but she was very good at responding to emails in a timely manner and answered questions well. She is a very easy grader.   "
2,5.0,1.0, POLSCI1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"Dr. Bowen is a really great professor. Her class was really interesting, interactive, and you can tell she's really passionate about what she does. She's also extremely nice; I was 0.02% away from a solid A in her class and didn't realize you could ask for a bump until the end of the next semester. She bent over backwards and bumped me anyway."
3,3.0,3.0, POLITSC1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"Professor Bowen is a decent professor at OSU Mansfield. She remains unbiased in the politics class, even though her opinion on the matter is clear. She is easy to get along with, and is quite understanding when you must miss a class. However, some of her material is difficult to understand. I often found myself using Google to look up answers."
4,4.0,2.0, POL1200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"Pretty good professor. She's very liberal but is pretty good at hiding her bias. Her lectures can be pretty boring. She decided to drop all exams so all there is to do is a final constitutional 'simulation', that is a lot of fun. Easy A and fairly interesting GE."
5,5.0,2.0, POLITSC1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"Gives great feedback and clearly outlines what she's looking for in her assignments. In class, she's able to moderate debate while not showing much bias toward either side."
6,5.0,2.0, POLSC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"I loved her class! She gives great feedback and goes above and beyond for her students. I loved how she makes sure everyone is involved in class discussions, but does not call on people if they do not know the answer. She also lets you use a cheat sheet on the midterm, and you get a take-home final. Be sure to pay attention and take good notes."
7,5.0,2.0, POLSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,one o my favorite professors eve!
8,5.0,4.0, POLSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"Rachel Bowen is an awesome professor, you really learn a lot in her class. If you put in the work, you will get good grades. She offers a lot of help and time if you need it, attending study sessions and asking questions makes the exams and papers easier."
9,5.0,4.0, POLISCI1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,Dr. Bowen is very passionate about Political Science and easily my favorite professor I had while on the Mansfield Campus. Would recommend her classes to anyone!
10,4.5,3.0, AMPOLITICS2002,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"Very hands on course. She encourages students to be involved and discuss issues during classes. Very helpful if you reach out to her. She also gives bonus points for perfect attendance, and has pretty simple exams. Definitely would take another one of her courses."
11,5.0,3.0, POLSCTORT,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"I really like her. I think she is tough, but very fair! She makes you think and work for your grade. I found the class to be very interesting. Not a slack off class. I found her to be very helpful answering questions. I would take another of her classes."
12,1.0,3.0, POLSC512,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"Heavy weighted classes.  Would not recommend anyone to take her classes.  They're boring as is her teaching style and personality.  I took two of her classes.  She's only there for her research funding.  Snobby too, with no reason to be."
13,1.5,3.0, POLTI512,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,Had for Poly Sci 101 & 512.  Unprofessional.  Class time was half spent discussing readings that had nothing to do with the lecture which followed.  Did not use Carmen.  Found these classes unchallenging and came out with the same knowledge I had going in.  Text books were not wisely chosen.
14,3.5,2.0, POLSC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"Professor Bowen was a pretty good instructor and she kept class fun. The only complaint I have is I don't feel like she did a very good job preparing us for the final. Since there were no exams during the quarter, I didn't really know what to expect of the final. Other than that she was great!"
15,5.0,4.0, POLSC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,Very smart and funny too! I would take another class with her. She is willing to answer questions. She doesn't assign much work but the work she does assign is interesting. She keeps class fun and wants her students to have a good time while learning. A valuable asset to OSU Mansfield!
16,4.5,2.0, POLSC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RACHEL,BOWEN,"Makes class fun by mixing lectures with powerpoints, discussions, and debates. Other than the readings, the only assignments all quarter are participating in one debate, 2 3-5 page papers, and the final which she is considering making take home. She likes to keep things interesting and wants you to have a good time. Definitely worth your time!"
