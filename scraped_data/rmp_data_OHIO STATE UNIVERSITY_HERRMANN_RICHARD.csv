1,2.5,3.0, PS4320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"He knows a lot about IR, however this class was the worst PS classes I've taken at OSU. The Game is cool but it does nothing for your grade. The prompts for the papers didn't give a clear picture of what was expected. You need to ready 80+ pages per week for the reading quizzes and the class average was less than 60%. He curves it, so its an easy B"
2,4.0,4.0, 4320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,Roughly 80 pages of reading a week. Pop quizzes throughout. Three exams. First exam had an in-class and out of class portion. In-class was a long-form essay. Out of class was a four page paper. Second exam was a four page paper. Third exam focused on the causal logics of the readings. You'll come away with vast knowledge if you put the time in. 
3,2.5,4.0, PS4320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"Professor Herrmann is a really great professor. He knows everything about IR and has experience like no other professor I know of. He has a tendency towards being curt and dismissive to students who want to take any time outside of lectures to talk. If you're looking for help, don't be offended by this. If you can talk to him, you'll learn a lot."
4,3.5,4.0, POLITSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"No doubt that Rick knows the material like the back of his hand. However, the lectures have little to no structure. Actively take notes to try to piece it all together. Exams are difficult and hard to prepare for. Definitely read the book before class; he likes to randomly call on people. In-class simulations were fun. Not an easy-A, but an easy-B."
5,1.5,4.0, PS545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,There is little structure to lectures and office hours do not prove helpful. Material is presented in the form of incoherent rants. The syllabus was not an accurate preview for this roller-coaster ride.
6,3.5,3.0, POLI545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"good lecturer, but I have find him biased individual.sometimes his tone comes out to resemble State Department spokesperson. otherwise great selection of the Academic journals(mostly current). I would encourage anyone who has serious interest of IR or U.S foreign policy to take this class with him."
7,4.0,4.0, PS545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"Great professor, really knowledgeable on the subject. Its a great class if you're into current events and international relations. The game simulation is really unique experience and a lot of fun. I would highly recommend taking this class, definitely one of the most fun PS classes I've taken."
8,4.0,4.0, PS545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"Herrmann is a very knowledgeable guy, worked in the State Dept and clearly has had practical experience with his subject. Still, he seems to genuinely enjoy teaching. Get to participate in a fun diplomatic ""game"" in second half of class. Midterm and final require lots of preparation, reading. Difficult class, but worth it."
9,3.0,4.0, PS550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"Class was a very interesting, although it was pretty much impossible to take notes during the lectures as he just stood up there and spoke freely.  He has a lot of experience and deserves a lot of respect for his knowledge on the subject. At the end of the class you play a foreign policy gamet that is a lot of fun.  The exams are no joke."
10,1.0,5.0, POLSC545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"A mess of a prof, no direction in lecture, impossible to take notes and study for exams. The only fun/useful part of the whole class is the strategy game you play the second half. But its in a building that is RIDICULOUSLY far away and there is no indication of this when you sign up."
11,4.5,4.0, PS545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"Absolutely loved this class and this man! It was so interesting and he's incredibly smart. You should really go to class and if you get into the assignments, you can come out of the class with vast knowledge on the subject matter. I would even take it again someday (and might audit it..). Definitely take it if you like international relations!"
12,3.5,5.0, POLS545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,Very challenging professor... the class is graded strictly on how everyone else in the class performs in the class... the exams are very difficult because you need to write exactly what he wants you to know- just do the readings and reread everything before the exams and go to all of the study groups and you'll be fine
13,5.0,4.0, POLISCI545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"Herrmann is a fantastic professor. He mixes good textbook information with current events with his own research incredibly well and does so in an interesting fashion. Be prepared to earn your grade if you want an A. The midterm and final are a **** to prepare, but it's very possible to do well. Don't slack off on the reading, or you'll regret it."
14,4.0,4.0, PS545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"Like the comments below, Herrmann is an incredible professor with as much experience and knowledge as you'd ever expect to find at OSU. His class is very professional and he treats the students like adults. That means he expects a lot from you. It's a great class, just make sure you leave plenty of time to do the work, cause there's a lot of it."
15,4.0,3.0, POLISCI545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"about as close to real world political science experience as you can get in a classroom. this guy is top notch in experience, knowledge etc and expects a lot from his students. very direct and open to student concerns, consider yourself lucky if he still has matt scherebath (sp?) as his TA."
16,5.0,3.0, PS545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,TAKE HIS CLASSES!  He is the most wornderful professor I've found in the Poli Sci Department.
17,4.0,4.0, POLYSI550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"He's a good teacher who used to serve as a UN Diplomat under old Bush.  His foreign relations class is excellent, he's very dedicated to helping students, and his real life experiences make for a very intersting and informative class.  Wish he taught more"
18,4.5,4.0, H597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"I think the Department's high placement in the national rankings has a lot to do with Dr. Herrmann. I'm in graduate school now, and his courses were bar-none the best preparation I received as an undergrad. He's the real thing--  don't waste his time."
19,5.0,2.0, PS545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,"Wonderful Professor.Very smart,very friendly and helpful.Will bend over backwards to help students and while his class is not easy,you'll learn a lot about foreign policy decision making. Great class."
20,5.0,1.0, 545,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,HERRMANN,AWESOME PROF!!! One of the best at OSU.
