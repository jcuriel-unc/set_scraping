1,5.0,4.0, POLI202,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"Prof McGuire is a great professor. He is witty so lectures are usually fun. He does rely heavily on test grades for the final grade, which is difficult if you have test anxiety. He is easy to reach and willing to accommodate. Great professor and I will be taking a class with him again."
2,5.0,3.0, POLI410,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"Amazing professor!!!! The material is quite interesting, he made it easy to actively participate and made students question their own judgement (in a good way). The exam questions are written answer and very straight forward but he's quite picky about your wording and specificity (beware!). PUT IN THE TIME TO STUDY

3,5.0,2.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"Prof. McGuire's class is unlike anything I've ever taken. At its root, you learn and understand court precedent through exploring and debating in class an issues history. About 80% of every class was devoted to discussion, which he drove with an energic albeit unhinged style. The class is based on tests which aren't hard if you know your stuff."
4,5.0,3.0, POLI410,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,Professor McGuire is amazing. He makes material that would be dry to many very interesting and fun to learn due to his charismatic lecture style and wide breadth of knowledge. Anyone who has an interest in American Law should seriously considering taking this class or any others taught by Professor McGuire. 
5,4.0,3.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"Great professor, really engaging, and pushes you to think critically about the positions you hold relative to the cases discussed. 3 exams and forum posts are all the grades in the class. Like has been stated before, no surprises and pretty straight forward. "
6,2.0,4.0, POLI410,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"Professor McGuire is a really nice guy and definitely wants to help, but I have never taken a more boring class at UNC - especially in the Poli department. Every class is just him lecturing about Supreme Court cases, and although that's the content of the class, he could have done so much more to make it engaging. A warning might have been nice."
7,5.0,3.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"Awesome lecturer and very knowledgeable about the stuff he talks about. He normally gives the facts of the case and has the class discuss what we think about it. He's also really good at expressing the arguments for both sides of the case, which makes the class a lot more interesting. Test are straightforward and don't have any surprises"
8,1.0,5.0, POLI79,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"Confusing. Last minute assignment changes, poor feedback, lack of clarity in class, assignment,mark and comments. RUDE."
9,5.0,4.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,Professor McGuire is by far the best professor Ive had at UNC and this is one of the most interesting classes I have taken as well. His lectures are very interesting and riddled with dad jokes. He goes over most cases in class and the rest come from the book. Graded on 3 tests and discussion posts on piazza.
10,4.0,2.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,His lectures are very interesting but he does not go over all the cases you will be tested on so prepare to read the textbook for certain cases. Pretty cool guy until you get to controversial cases where he has to play devil's advocate to make students participate in the discussion.
11,5.0,4.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"McGuire is dedicated to making you understand why court cases were decided the way they were and on what basis. He is fascinating, knowledgeable, and tells great dad-jokes. He is a must for any POLI student focusing on US constitutional politics. He expects precise answers but exams are based in the lectures - no surprise questions."
12,3.0,3.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"Prof McGuire is a nice guy and his lectures are interesting enough. Your grade for the class is almost entirely based on three case-analysis exams (28% each) and there is no extra credit. He's quite a rigorous grader, wanting your answers to be exact and not really entertaining much creative interpretation. But an overall cool guy and solid prof!"
13,4.0,3.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"This is the 3rd class I've taken with McGuire & he's a great professor. (FYI they're all the same in terms of format). During Zoom Uni he's recorded & posted all his lectures online. I also recommend utilizing Oyez for his classes, it helps a lot! There aren't a lot of grades but if you pay attention & take notes it's fine! Dry but great humor"
14,5.0,3.0, POLI410,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"McGuire is easily one of the best professors in the poli sci department. If you have any interest in the Supreme Court or are considering law school, definitely take this class! McGuire's lectures are fun and engaging, but it is worth noting that attending class is essential to doing well in the class."
15,5.0,2.0, POLI490,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"All assignments and exams were super clear and easy to understand. The textbook readings were short and clear as well. His exams are only hard if you don't attend class or are not able to independently understand the readings, as we never go over them in class. McGuire as a person is hilarious and very understanding. Would take any class with him!"
16,5.0,3.0, POLI202,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"If you're a political science major or interested in the Supreme Court, take this class. Professor McGuire is easily one of the best teachers I have had here at UNC, no cap. The grading and assignments are clear and McGuire makes the class enjoyable. Also, McGuire is definitely the funniest teacher at UNC."
17,5.0,3.0, POLI202,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"McGuire is hilarious and super knowledgeable about his subject. He is very caring, but also is not afraid to call you out- in a funny way. The class is based off 3 in-class essays which total to 10% of your grade and then 3 exams that are 30% each of your grade. The final is essentially a 3rd exam and only based on material after the 2nd exam."
18,5.0,3.0, POLI410,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"Professor McGuire is my favorite Poli professor because of the clear and interesting way he teaches.  Though test prep may take some time, there are no curve balls on his tests.  Attendance and participation aren't required, but by going and paying attention you'll have all that you need for the lecture part of the tests.  Very nice and funny guy!"
19,4.5,3.0, POLI411,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,"Professor McGuire has become one of my favorite professors at UNC. If you're interested in anything related to the Supreme Court or the Constitution, he's the best pick. I've also taken his Supreme Court class and it was excellent! Professor McGuire is a fantastic lecturer and always encourages student dialogue. "
20,4.5,2.0, POLI410,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KEVIN,MCGUIRE,Professor McGuire has been one of my favorite professors at UNC. The course was 4 non cumulative tests and a 10 page paper. He is clear about expectations and he is an engaging lecturer. If you are pre-law I would highly suggest taking him as this class is mostly constitutional case study.
