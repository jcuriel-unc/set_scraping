1,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"Dr. Sathy is an awesome professor! She cares about her students and makes an effort to see that everyone is on the same page. I wasn't a huge fan of stats at the beginning of the semester, but I grew to love it. She's lenient with the way the class is taught and tries her best to appeal to different learning styles. She's a gem, highly recommend :)"
2,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"I have never taken a stats class before, so I was super nervous coming into this class. Watch her videos before class and do the WS before exams and you are golden. Prior to covid, she was really funny in class. She was also aware of everyone's situations bc of covid. I wish I could take another class with her. 10/10 definitely recommend!"
3,5.0,2.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"She's such a queen. She really cares about us and was so accommodating with the pandemic. I took AP Stats in high school, but I thought this class was super easy as long as you take the video notes and participate in class. Recitation is kind of pointless, but since its a 4-hour class she doesn't have a choice. Take this class she's the best!!!!!!!"
4,1.0,1.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"Dr. Sathy clearly cares about her students, but often spends too much time making sure you know that. She wastes a lot of class time talking about things that aren't related to stats at all. I also don't feel she understands the material because I took AP stats in high school and learned way more from my high school teacher than I have her."
5,5.0,4.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"Dr. Sathy is a gem of a professor. She validates the busy schedule of her students and provides so many resources to do well. Instead of readings, you can watch her videos showing the material, you're expected to do this before class. The homework given is reasonable and serves to help you prepare for exams."
6,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,One of the best professors I have had. So caring and understanding of students. She teaches the material so well and makes it possible for you to succeed in this course.
7,4.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"Dr. Sathy is an amazing person who loves her students more than anything and really wants them to succeed. She simplifies the material during lecture, but the exams don't exactly reflect that. The exams have trick questions. The course resources are pretty disorganized which makes it overwhelming."
8,5.0,2.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"Sathy is the best prof I have ever had. She is so kind and has multiple opportunities to receive help outside of class. She actually wanted every student in her class to succeed. Tests and assignments were fair. Learned material by watching videos before class, but they were helpful. She went over confusing material in lecture. Amazing professor."
9,4.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"She makes her own instructional videos that you're required to watch before class. I thought her questions weren't always optimally-worded, but overall, she's a lot better than other professors and is pretty nice."
10,4.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"Dr. Sathy is such a caring professor, always available to help you with the material or anything you need. Her lecture videos are the most helpful resource in the class, but attend lecture if you care about participation. The exams can be difficult but lots of practice and review is available. The group project at the end is not hard."
11,4.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"If you attend class, watch the all the videos, and stay on top of the work, this class will be fine for you. Professor Sathy is genuinely cares about how her students do, and is very kind. She teaches statistics in a fun way, and going to class was fun and helpful."
12,5.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"Super caring teacher and if you watch the videos and study before the exams you'll be fine. Stay on top of your work and make sure to review when you can because the material does build on a bit. The material can be a bit tricky at times, but it shouldn't be too hard to get a good grade."
13,5.0,2.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,loveeee sathy!! honestly one of the most caring professors I've had at unc. she genuinely wants her students to succeed and is very accessible outside class. it is easy to do well in her class if you put in the effort and she gives lots of extra credit opportunities as well! 10/10 recommend
14,5.0,1.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"I have seen a lot of unfair comments below. Dr. Sathy is so nice and what requires in this class is just intro-level math (STOR 155) which most people would get a high score as long as they know how to calculate. Also, she gave us so many extra credits opportunities. (totally 6% added to my final grade) Easy A if putting enough efforts into it."
15,2.0,5.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,This class was harder than it should have been. The professor is nice and caring but her test are tricky!! My advice is to treat it more like a math class because that's what it felt like :(
16,4.0,3.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"if you thought Ap Stat was easy, this is basically that but with like two more concepts. Dr. Sathy really does care about her students and does a good job staying on top of it. just watch the videos and you'll keep up."
17,3.0,4.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,Dr. Sathy is a very nice person in the classroom but she's a different person meeting one on one. The majority of your grade is exams (75%) & they're really challenging and tough. There's lots homework assignments. She does care about her students but I would consider other options before choosing this professor. Also hated the flipped classroom!!
18,4.0,4.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"Dr. Sathy is very kind, and it's obvious that she cares about her students. With that being said, I hate her flipped classroom model, and I think that the class is much harder than it needs to be because of that. I would take another class with her if there was no other professor options, but she wouldn't be my first choice."
19,5.0,1.0, PSYC89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"Kinda a joke. Had to get laser cutter certified, work in groups to build math ""tools"". Did it for the QR gen ed. Easiest FYS on earth. Dr. Sathy is an angel and honestly treated us like 10 year olds, feel like she really enjoyed being with freshman."
20,4.0,5.0, PSYC210,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,VIJI,SATHY,"While I hated the class that was being taught, Dr. Sathy is a pretty good and caring professor. She gives a lot of homework, but most of it is just so you know how to handle the material. However, her tests are kinda tough so beware."
