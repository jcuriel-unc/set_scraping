1,3.5,5.0, H508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HAL,ARKES,Dr. Arkes was a very good professor. I really had no interest in judgement and decision making before I entered his classroom but now I have a new understanding and respect for the subject matter. The only complaints that I would have would be we did not have a textbook which made things hard. The class is challenging but very interesting.

5,5.0,3.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HAL,ARKES,"He's a GREAT teacher, but watch out for the paper at the end of the class.  I had to take a LOT of time to research for it.  He's a great teacher and it's a great class but don't get lazy!"

9,4.0,3.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HAL,ARKES,"Very good teacher!  My favorite psych class I've taken for the past 4 years.  The only hard part is that there is a big paper at the end and a cumulative final, but there are many small assigments along the way for the paper so you can't get behind."
10,3.0,3.0, 508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HAL,ARKES,He does know his stuff but do not get on his bad side. If you do he will undermine you in a passive aggressive way.
11,5.0,3.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,HAL,ARKES,"Course material is difficult, but he makes it understandable and interesting. Very helpful. Liberal grader and very fair. Big paper, but you pick the topic. Definitely would take him again...brilliant."
