1,4.0,4.0, PSYCH4305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,He is good lecturer but the class is VERY EXHAUSTING. you'll have to read over 300 SLIDES PER MIDTERM(this is no exaggeration). Tests r REALLY DETAILED (70 questions long) and final (which is about 140 questions) is CUMULATIVE so you'll have to review 800 SLIDES. btw NO CURVE cuz avg is 88. Only take it if you have the time to study for it.
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"Dr. Wenk was great; he made the material incredibly interesting and very easy to learn. The overall grade is intimidating because it's only based on two midterms and a final, but his exams are very fair and straight out of his slides. He and his TAs offer lots of office hours for extra help and he is one of the most personable professors I've had."
3,5.0,4.0, PSYCH4305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"Dr Wenk is wonderful! His class was really difficult for me, but he is hilarious and makes the content relatable. Definitely go to class, it helps to hear him explain it rather than teach yourself from the slides. Only grades are tests, so gotta study a lot, for days beforehand in order to do well. I would definitely take another class with him!"
4,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"Dr. Wenk is by far one of the most incredible professors you will ever have. He is a tough professor, but it was 100% worth every second. He is absolutely hilarious and you learn so much. Take him if you have the chance"
5,4.0,3.0, PSYCH4305,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"Dr. Wenk is very knowledgable and down-to-earth with his students. Lecture is pretty important, as he explains a lot that aren't in his slides. You could probably pass without going to lecture, but I wouldn't recommend it because they're just so interesting. There's also just a lot of material covered in this class, so going to lecture helps."
6,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"Great Professor. Made lectures very interesting, and always was willing to answer questions. He really cares about his students and what he is teaching. Exams were fairly tough and detailed, but everything was from the slides."
7,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"He is truly amazing. He knows just about everything to know about neuroscience. He has amazing stories and gives great lectures. You have to study all the material and remember a lot, but the class is awesome!"
8,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"Absolutely loved this professor. He was always able to keep lectures interesting and would work in funny stories and examples. Difficult class because the only grades are tests, but overall I still enjoyed the course."
9,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"Go to the the lectures, memorize the slides and you will get an A."
10,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,You will do very well if you study. Grades are determined by the tests. All the material is based off of the power points and what he says. Going to office hours will help because he repeats content from lecture then.
11,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"If you love the brain, you will love Dr. Wenk's class! His class was by far my favorite and I looked forward to going every time. I recommend taking advantage his office hours, because he is amazing to get to know. To succeed in this class, attend every class and take as many notes as you can for reference on some of the vague slides."
12,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"First thing to note: this class has a different grading scale: A  88%, A-  85%, and so on.  Second thing: he doesn't go off any textbook, instead using his own PowerPoint slides.  My advice: either print off the slides and take notes on them during lecture or take notes on your laptop and transfer them to printed slides to study.  Helped a lot."
13,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,Dr. Wenk is one of the best professors at OSU. Very knowledgable and funny during his lectures. Exams are tough but fair because he usually curves them.
14,5.0,4.0, PSY3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"Easily one of the nicest people I've met and he cares a lot about his students and the subject. You absolutely have to go to class to do well, his lecture slides he posts are very vague if you don't have your own notes from him elaborating. There is a lot of information too and you have to study a lot and hard to understand it all."
15,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"Serious love/hate relationship. He is very entertaining and you will learn a lot and love neuroscience. He is very knowledgeable and can/will answer all questions no matter how annoying you are. However, at times he can seem to be degrading towards doctors and anyone that is not him. Large/earned ego, but it can get to you sometimes so be prepared"
16,5.0,4.0, PSY3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"Dr. Wenk is the best professor I've had at OSU.  It was a pleasure to be in his class.  His tests are fair, but attending lecture is key.  This man is a genius, take advantage of all of his knowledge in office hours!  I would go out of my way to take another class with him."
17,5.0,3.0, PSY3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,Awesome professor - most definitely will make you interested in the brain
18,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"If you're even slightly interested about what goes on in your brain, take this class. He'll make you want to change your major to neuroscience."
19,3.5,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Wenk's class! His lectures were very informative and fun. The textbook was not necessary because his powerpoints covered everything tested, but some of his powerpoints/slides could be confusing. Exams were challenging, but not impossible. Overall, a great professor!"
20,4.0,2.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GARY,WENK,"Quick paced but very interesting lectures. Would take him again, want to take his psychopharm class! I didn't find the class that hard, but some did. I think it really depends on your interest in behavioral psych and previous knowledge of basic brain anatomy, psych, etc."
