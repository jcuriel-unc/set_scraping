1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VIRGINIA,TOMPKINS,"SHE IS AMAZING! The material is kinda hard but she makes it so you LEARN it! The exams are reasonable, she gives study guides, extra credit, answers all questions, always replies, and honestly has so much passion for teaching the material! She has a lot of compassion&is friendly. You would be a fool to NOT take this class! It's fun!"
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VIRGINIA,TOMPKINS,I loved Dr. Tompkins lecture videos! Her fully online course was so easy to follow. The weekly modules are very manageable. She really cares about her students and knows what shes talking about! I loved how she got students involved with the weekly readings. Make sure you study for her exams and stay on track with the final project early on!
3,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VIRGINIA,TOMPKINS,One of the best professors I have had. Very understanding and explains material very well.
4,3.0,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VIRGINIA,TOMPKINS,"You have to keep up with either going to class or reading all the slides (which arent all the way filled out and you learn some terms in class only). It wasn't hard, per se. The lectures aren't all that exciting besides the biweekly activity. She is a good instructor, you just have to pay very close attention"
5,4.5,3.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VIRGINIA,TOMPKINS,She is the reason why I am minoring in developmental psychology. Her classes were always interesting even though we took a lot of notes! Virginia also made it to were there was no way you didn't understand what she was talking about. 
6,4.5,3.0, 3340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VIRGINIA,TOMPKINS,I love her!! She is the best prof. ever!!! I wish I could take all of her classes! I love the way she explains and talks in her lectures! Even just the class topics are very interesting.
