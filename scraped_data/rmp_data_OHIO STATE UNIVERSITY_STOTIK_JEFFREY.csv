1,1.0,5.0, SOC3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,He is not tech savvy so tests are on college ruled paper so you have to write during the exam which is annoying. Do not take his class if you wanna fail. lectures are boring and waste of time. He doesn't take attendance and the exams are graded pout of 50 points. there is 1 final paper thats 100 points 
2,1.0,5.0, SOC3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK," his lectures are boring. there are 3 exam,1 final,13 discussions,1 paper. Exams are 5 questions and you have to answer in essay like answers. I thought I was doing great on my exam until he gave me a 8/50 and I asked him why and he said because u didn't throughly explain. But I studied off of his study guide so I was confused. DO NOT TAKE HIM."
3,4.0,3.0, SOC2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Jeff is a great man and lecturer, but disorganized. Class is light with only 1 discussion post per week. There are 3 opinion papers that he'll give you an A on if you follow his directions. Tests are super hard, VERY specific short answer response that must be a paragraph each. Super hard to get an A on tests. Still probably the easiest of 2367s.  "
4,2.0,2.0, SOC3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Grades are pretty test heavy.  He's not super tech-savvy, so your study guides and lecture notes are Word docs with 100 words on them. But the tests are exactly like the study guide, just know you have to write as many details as you can remember in order to get a good grade. Most of my learning was outside the classroom instead of his lectures"
5,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Jeff is really nice and cares about his students. For this class you have weekly discussion posts and 4 exams but they aren't that hard, so as long as you watch the weekly lectures and take notes you'll get an A. "
6,4.0,2.0, SOCIOL236702,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,Nice guy.  Not too much work for a writing class.  Sometimes lectures were boring.  Show up to class and you'll do well.
7,5.0,3.0, SOC2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Jeff is a nice and easygoing professor and gives interesting lectures. Class grade is made up of 4 exams, 3 papers, and 10 weekly discussion posts. Papers are gradely leniently but you need to study for the exams. Use the study guide he gives! Overall an ok class and not a hard A. "
8,4.0,3.0, SOCIOL2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Overall, I enjoyed this class and was fascinated by the material. It was sometimes hard to want to watch the long lectures, but it was worth the watch. 2 2-page papers, a weekly discussion post, 4 10-question short response tests, and one term paper (7-10 pages). Did not provide feedbacks on papers, but did not grade them hard. "
9,5.0,1.0, SOC2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Dr. Stotik has a very dry humor and tends to go on tangents, so his lectures are very interesting and funny. You have to complete a few papers and his exams are short answer responses. Overall, you probably don't have to attend class to do well but the lectures can be helpful for specific exam questions. Absolutely would recommend him."
10,5.0,4.0, SOCIOL236702,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Good ole Jeff is so nice and really cares about his students. His lectures are interesting, even when he goes off on tangents. He grades his essays pretty easily and is lenient. He looks for specific answers on his tests, but theyre not bad at all, you always know what information will be on the test because of his study guides."
11,3.0,2.0, SOCIOL236702,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Took this class back in Fall of 2020, so it was a hybrid class. I meant to type in SOCIOL2367.02, but Rate My Prof doesn't allow decimals. Gave me 100% on all of my papers and I didn't even complete all the readings. If you need an easy 2nd year writing and want to learn a bit about metroplitan cities (like CBus), this was a good class to do so in."
12,5.0,3.0, SOC3463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Weekly discussion posts, one final reflection paper, four tests. This class was very laid back and the lectures were very interesting, I actually enjoyed coming each week. Dr Stotik was cool and understanding throughout the semester - I would recommend taking this class!"
13,5.0,1.0, SOC2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Great dude. Had him for deviance too, very casual classroom environment, lectures aren't mandatory, but this class gives you what you put into it. It can absolutely be a blown off easy A, but you can learn a lot if you pay attention and participate"
14,5.0,1.0, SOC3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"You don't really have to go to class, attendance isn't mandatory but it will help on tests. I show up to classes, took very little notes and got 100% or above on every tests. All tests are formatted the same and he essentially gives you the test questions beforehand."
15,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Liked him so much I'm taking another one of his classes. Super cool guy, sometimes gets a little distracted but I didn't mind. Tests are easy as long as you take notes. Missed like 2 points all semester, very clear what was expected."
16,3.0,1.0, SOCIOL2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"I took this class as a gen ed for my major, and it is the easiest class I have taken thus far. I only went to class for about the first month of the semester, and I haven't gone since then because lectures are not required to do well; I have a 100% in the class right now. As long as you use the notes he provides for the tests, you will be fine!"
17,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"I did not even lose one single point from any assignment or exam in his class throughout the semester. As long as you write essays clearly and based on questions, you will get full points. Exams cannot be even easier. Dr. Stotik is also a very friendly and hilarious person in class, and I like talking with him."
18,3.0,2.0, SOCIOL236702,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"Honestly, there isn't anything to say about Professor Stotik. There are 6 papers due throughout the year, but they were each only 2 pages double-spaced. It might be nice to attend lecture, but his exams come directly from his notes and he will occasionally include things from the readings he assigns but not very often."
19,5.0,2.0, SOCIO3463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"I think he is a good instructor and very energetic. Besides, I think relating to the current events is useful. Going to the lecture is necessary."
20,4.0,3.0, SOCIOL3463,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JEFFREY,STOTIK,"If you do the basics, go to class, read etc, you'll get a decent grade. Lectures were usually interesting, sometimes humorous. He is really into what he's teaching."
