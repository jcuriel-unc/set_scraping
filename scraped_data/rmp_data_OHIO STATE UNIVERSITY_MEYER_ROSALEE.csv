1,5.0,4.0, PSYCH4510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"I feel that Dr. Meyer's Psych 4510 was difficult, but manageable with effort. She is pretty responsive to emails with questions, which definitely helps. Almost everyone in the class receives an A or a B. She's a pretty tough grader on the writing assignments, but there are so many of them that one bad grade doesn't really effect your overall grade."
2,5.0,2.0, PSY3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,Dr. Meyer is very energetic and funny. Makes class enjoyable and entertaining. sometimes she throws candy at us for participating. Lots of easy assignments but you get multiple tries. lots of tophat but they're easy 
3,4.0,2.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"This class is really manageable and interesting! Dr. Meyer is very approachable and kind. Make sure to go to lecture, as TH is important for your grade and there are in-person activities that will tank your grade if you miss them. Just go to class, do your assignments - and you'll get an A."
4,5.0,1.0, PSY3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"Dr. Meyer is just lovely! Her lectures were as entertaining as they were informative and she's super approachable and kind. She provided a scanned/pdf format to give us a free textbook, and her assignments were super easy but still help you to learn. Make sure you attend lectures though because she does do some in-class activities and TopHat. "
5,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,I did not need to buy a textbook. She is very flexible with deadlines and participation. There were no big exams just many different types of assignments. Best teacher and fun class! You can tell she wants you to do well in the class.
6,1.0,5.0, PSYCH4510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"Got a good grade in the class, but had to work tirelessly to get it. The grading critera is unclear, the templates given are overwhelming, and little to no guidance is given before you have to write. Grading is super tough and is looked at as if you are supposed to be a PhD student. Dr. Meyer was not good at walking us through the final paper. "
7,1.0,5.0, PSYCH4510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"This class is formatted so poorly. We are given barely any guidelines on the papers, but then graded as if we are well established professional researchers. my parent wrote a dissertation and even she doesn't understand how we are being graded so harshly as an undergrad. I honestly have no idea how anyone could have a good grade in this class. "
8,1.0,3.0, PSYCH4510,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"Assignment rubrics: Not clear
Timeline to present research: Extremely tight ie. 1 weeks to code, modify, and gather participants
Teaching style: Just end up using a lot of Purdue Owl guides then tells you to reference it. 
Assignments: Paper heavy, 1 paper every 2 weeks usually. Not difficult but you get no support in writing it. "
9,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"Dr. Meyer's cognitive psych class is literally the easiest class I've ever taken. Papers are practically for participation because she's not looking for the most beautiful piece of art, and all 5 online quizzes have 2 attempts to get it right. Homework is super easy too. Least amount of work I've ever had for a class in college."
10,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,Dr. Meyer is probably my favorite professor that I've had thus far at OSU. She has a great personality and prioritizes learning over memorization and grading. She is a great in person lecturer and also provides online video lectures. She really knows what she's talking about and is really detailed with the material. Uses practical assignments.
11,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,One of the very few professors that want you to actually learn the information. She does not rely on tests to check your knowledge. Had great humor and was very caring.
12,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"Dr. Meyer is enthusiastic, makes showing up to class worthwhile, understanding, and a great professor overall.I would highly recommend you take her if you're a psych major or need to fulfill a GE req. She is super chill and engages with her classes wonderfully. She conveys material concretely, and was very flexible pre and post pandemic."
13,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,She is the best!
14,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,Dr. Meyer is so sweet and understanding and as long as you do her work you can get an A. She tries to make the content more fun and provides extra credit.
15,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"Dr. Meyer is great. The class content can be dry, but she does her best to make it interesting and fun to learn about. This class was an easy A because of the sheer amount of extra credit opportunities and the fact that she drops the lowest grades from ALL categories. Quizzes and papers were easy if you watched the lectures. Strongly recommend her!"
16,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"Prof. Meyer was so caring and kind. Her class was boring, but I think thats just because I dont find the topic interesting. Regardless, she was always so accommodating, and honestly the class was rather easy. You basically do activities for your grade."
17,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,One of the most enjoyable classes Ive had at osu. The homework is always easy and interesting. Quizzes were all open note with no time limit and she offers extra credit. Dr Meyer is quick to answer emails and her lectures were always enjoyable to sit through.
18,4.0,1.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"This class was so easy and Dr. Meyer was super understanding and helpful. Tons of extra credit available, she often extends deadlines, and very clear grading criteria. Exam questions were taken straight from her quizzes. Nice easy A, and you can tell she really wants her students to succeed!"
19,5.0,1.0, PSYCH3312,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,"Her subject is kind of boring, but she does her best to make lectures fun. She was a great professor before the COVID-19 situation, but after we went to online she was particularly amazing. She was very understanding of our situation and was always kind. She drops the lowest exams, and smaller assignments are easy. Easy, fun, definitely recommend."
20,4.0,1.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROSALEE,MEYER,She is very generous about giving high grades and it is an easy A class even if you don't study hard. She is a very nice and easy-going person who is always willing to help. But honestly the content is a bit too boring.
