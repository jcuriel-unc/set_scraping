1,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"Dr. Yocom has great lectures that included slides, videos, charts, and examples. She allows a front&back page of notes on exams, uses TopHat for feedback & getting-to-know-you questions, gives 3 1-pagers throughout the sem, 3 extra credit assignments, is available after class, will meet to discuss exam grades, & encourages discussion in class."
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"Dr. Yocom is a wonderful instructor who always makes your contributions feel valued. The course is mostly discussion based, which helps keep your attention. I'll admit, the textbook homework was unnecessarily tedious, but you get used to it. Because it covers the whole lifespan, be prepared to take a lot of information in...a lot..."
3,5.0,4.0, PSYCH3551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,Yocom was a great teacher!  I did not like the fact that most classes were mostly a discussion rather than a lecture.  It was more of students' opinions rather than the lectures.  The tests were okay but the questions came from the book rather than the lecture.  Attendance was not mandatory but would have in-class activities randomly.
4,2.0,4.0, 3340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"Too many reading assignments that require us to complete a maximum of more than 200 questions. Credits are not given for correctness, but still painful and time-consuming. Especially when two readings are due in one week! The exam allows one page of notes. But questions could be a lot and very detailed. Not an easy A to get even compared to 3513."
5,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3340H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"Reading homework is excessive. Each chapter requires us to anwser over 75 concept questions, which takes a long time to complete. This has affected my focus on other classes and as a result, have become more stressed. Being successful in this course requires completing reading assignments, being an active notetaker, and studying hard for exams."
6,3.0,3.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"She's pleasant and cares about her students. Has a quiz every week on the long readings, and these affect your grade. Don't skip. Allows one OOPS pass that allows you to drop your lowest grade. Beyond this, she's inflexible; no extra credit with her. Doesn't upload class slides online. TAKE NOTES! Allows one page of notes (double-sided) for exams."
7,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3340H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"Amazing class and Dr. Yocum is extremely passionate about the content. She doesn't always cover every point during lecture so there are LONG interactive readings for homework. Attendance is really only mandatory on the days when in activities due in class. 

I certainly felt lost after the one class I missed. She allows 1 pg notes for the exams. "
8,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"Dr. Yocom has great lectures that include a variety of material like slides, videos, charts, and examples that we look at in class. She allows a front&back page of notes on exams, uses TopHat for reading questions, and had 3 1-page papers throughout the semester. She's available after class for questions and encourages discussion in class. "
9,2.0,3.0, PSYCH3550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"She is not a great lecturer in my opinion, but I think it was worse for me because this class is only two days a week which makes the classes longer. I get very bored in her lectures, she use the same phrases over and over, and I don't love the way that she responds to some people when they offer their point of view (acts uninterested)."
10,5.0,2.0, 2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"Took this as a summer course and it was well worth it. She offered so much extra credit and it was for easy stuff too. The textbook made things confusing but her lectures were always short and very helpful. You don't have to do any actual math on the exams, just on the homework. She always encourages people to reach out with questions."
11,3.0,3.0, 2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,The class was fine. It was not particularly interesting to me. I got a low grade because I put very little effort in but it was definitely not a hard class. There was also a lot of extra credit offered. It was not a bad class I just don't like statistics and I wasn't engaged in it . 
12,3.0,3.0, PSY2200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"Dr. Yocom is a good professor, but I don't think I would take another one of her classes because quite honestly she is annoying. She definitely knows what she is talking about but makes things a lot more complicated than they should be. Go to the learning lab and get extra credit and don't forget to go on attendance days."
13,5.0,1.0, PSY2200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"The class itself wasn't my favorite, and I would have preferred to use a textbook to PyscLearn, but that's simply because of how math-y it is. Dr. Yocom is very understanding and approachable and gives lots of opportunities for extra credit! Overall, her teaching style was easy to understand and wasn't overwhelming, would definitely recommend her!"
14,4.0,2.0, 2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,Dr. Yocom sincerely cares about her students a lot and is very accessible outside of class. If you took AP Statistics in high school you'll do great. Attendance is required on chapter practice days. She offers a TON of extra credit opportunities- and no calculation problems on exams. Take this class with her!
15,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3340H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,I thought this would be an easy class as I've taken child psych. Wrong. So much textbook reading. Started class online but randomly took away that option. NEED TO GO TO CLASS. Exams are a thumbs down. Not nearly enough time & too specific. Don't think I learned anything. 100% regret taking this class.
16,5.0,3.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,"I had Dr. Yocom for PSYCH 1100H last semester, and although I had never studied psych ever before, she made it so much easier for me to understand. In my experience, I found that the lecture notes were the most essential thing even though I still used the textbook. She also really cares about all her students. Definitely recommend!!!"
17,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,A great professor for this class. You only need to show up when you do the chapter practices and there are a lot of opportunities to get your grade up. If you can take this class with her I would recommend it.
18,5.0,3.0, PSY1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,LOVED this class! Prof Yocom made me want to attend class -- she made things interesting and kept us involved.
19,5.0,3.0, PSY2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,Dr. Yocom made this class much better than I expected! Go to class and ask questions when they come up!
20,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANNA,YOCOM,If you come to class and listen you will be fine. Tests are completely fair. She seemed to be that professor that wanted to be more reasonable Bc she knows we have other classes and that made me appreciative.
