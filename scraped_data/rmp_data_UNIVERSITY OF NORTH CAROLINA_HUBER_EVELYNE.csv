1,3.0,4.0, POLI238H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"We had a lot of work since she re-used recorded lectures from last semester on top of the long readings. The readings also sometimes didn't feel applicable to class, more just a tour of her research background. But she's nice and very knowledgable about the material, even if class discussions weren't the most interesting."
2,2.0,3.0, POLI238H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"Really sweet lady and incredibly smart. She was always very helpful and graded assignments pretty easily. That said, she did assign about 60 pages of heavy reading along with an asynchronous lecture before every class. Also a 10 page research paper wasn't fun. Might be better in person but just a crazy amount of work."
3,3.0,4.0, POLI238H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"She never really taught anything in class. She assigns a ton of unnecessary reading plus long lectures to watch before then just places us into breakout rooms that are a waste of time for half of class for us to discuss her ""Powerpoints."" She's nice and clearly smart about the subject, but very stats. heavy & boring. I would try a diff. Latin prof."
4,5.0,4.0, POLI238H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"A lot of the work lies in processing the information and learning how to do research. You're don't need to worry about years and dates, focus on causes and effects and really digging into them. Sometimes she expects familiarity with things that you might be unaware of, or you might not understand her accent, but she's great when you ask questions!"
5,5.0,4.0, POLI731,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"Taking Prof. Huber's PhD class as an undergrad this semester. She is charismatic, elegant, and enthusiastic towards her field, yet super humorous and down-to-earth! Really inspired by her!"
6,5.0,1.0, POLI691H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"Huber may be difficult in lower level courses, but she's great as the POLI Honors prof. If you're considering the POLI Honors sequence, don't let these other reviews sway you-- she's amazing and very laid back in 691H. I don't think anyone received less than an A-."
7,5.0,3.0, POLI691H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"She gives good feedback and is clear with what she wants to be done. She's open to reworking stuff because she isn't giving feedback to be rude, but because she wants improvement and the best from her students. She's nice, too. She brought paper to class one day because we mainly use computers and it was so sweet i love her"
8,2.0,4.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"Very unclear grading. I was consistently told  I was performing well in the course, and then given a grade much lower than what was expected. Many of my peers have experienced the same issue. Lectures are awful and difficult to follow. The TAs are extremely helpful in clarifying, but the prof herself just doesn't know how to teach."
9,3.0,3.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"This class taught me a lot and I would recommend it to other POLI majors. However, the way she grades is extremely unclear, no one really knows the point system except for her. Her TA (Guzel) was AMAZING. The actual lectures are hard to follow because they're kind of all over the place, but Guzel really helps to clear everything up in recitation!"
10,3.5,3.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"The course requires a comprehensive knowledge of Latin American politics to be successful on the midterm and final. Huber is really helpful when it comes to preparing for the midterm/final, but she can tend to be dry during lectures. She puts all her Powerpoints online, so it's not completely necessary to read the book, although it's helpful."
11,3.0,4.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"Dr. Huber is definitely an expert at Contemporary Latin American Politics, but she has problems conveying her knowledge to the students. This exams are essay based and pretty comprehensive, but not too difficult if you come to class and go to recitation. Grade consists of Mid Term, Final, Research Paper, and Recitation participation."
12,3.0,3.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"Interesting course material, but Professor Huber tends to be dry.  She does not allow laptops and lectures from a powerpoint every class.  The exams are somewhat detailed but not difficult if you come to lecture and pay attention.  She does grade on a curve, based on how the TA's grade you.  I would recommend this course only to POLI majors."
13,3.5,4.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"Pros: She is clearly an expert in her field and is good at explaining things. Cons: Lectures could get kind of boring and we couldn't use laptops, which made it challenging to take notes because she talks kind of fast. Overall, this class is difficult but I would still recommend her as a professor."
14,1.0,5.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,Avoid at all costs.
15,4.0,4.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"She was a good Prof.  The class could get pretty boring, but she tried.  She is most def one of those people that would probably do better in a small class.  The exams and pop quizzes are that hard as long as you do the reading.  The amount of reading does suck."
16,2.0,4.0, POLI265,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"Latin American Politics - pretty boring class, questions on tests asked for minute details which you probably wouldn't think were that important in the readings.  She grades really hard, as well...I didn't really like this class at all"
17,1.5,5.0, POLI86,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"I can't remember the exact number of this class since courses changed, but it was Latin American Politics.  She is the worse teacher probably in the Poli Sci Dept. She's a complete communist... Everything wrong in Latin America is the CIA's fault according to her- no detail into economics of the turmoilous political climate.  Hard and worthless!"
18,3.0,4.0, POLI56,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"If you are interested in Latin American politics you will do alright, but if not- there is little she does to get you interested.  It is also a lot of reading and mid terms/ final is in class essay so you really have to know your stuff."
19,2.0,4.0, POLI56,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,"So incredibly boring, does little to engage the class, I fall asleep almost every time"
20,1.5,5.0, POLI56,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,EVELYNE,HUBER,The only class I've ever fallen asleep in
