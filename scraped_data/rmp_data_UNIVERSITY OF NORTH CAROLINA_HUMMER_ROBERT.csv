1,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"100% of your grade is composed of exams, but they are extremely easy. I think you could get by with an A on the exams by just guessing. If you listen to his lectures, which he records, you're good to go. You don't really need to do the readings. Attendance wasn't required and since the slides were uploaded and class was recorded, it was nice."
2,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"Professor Hummer is the sweetest human to walk the Earth. His class is based on four exams, and if you use the study guides provided, you will do well. He truly cares about his students and is super passionate about what he teaches. He is very knowledgable, and you honestly learn a lot via readings, lectures, and exams. Amazing guy!"
3,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"Easiest class I've taken here. You are graded on 4 exams that honestly you could get an A in without having gone to class. I skipped every class, used online quizlets to study and got an A. Despite this, I still learned a ton because of how he formats the exams (he makes the right answer obvious so you learn as youre taking the test. "
4,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,Could not recommend this class more. Graded by 3 tests and a final. Test are easy if you pay attention in class and complete the study guides. He looks at your improvement in the class and decides your final grade himself. 
5,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,Great class and a great professor!
6,5.0,1.0, SOC172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,I love this man; he is clearly passionate about population health and is very caring. I would definitely take his class again.
7,5.0,1.0, SOC172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,Robert Hummer is an amazing guy and the course is not difficult at all. Make sure to do the study guides because every term you see on the study guide will be on the exam! This class was quite easy and very insightful. Take this class!!!! 
8,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,Great class. Final grade is based on 3 easy exams. As long as you pay attention and have some kind of common sense you'll be fine.
9,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"Dr. Hummer is such a sweetheart! His lectures are engaging, and he made me more interested in the content than I already was. The class is based on 3 tests and a final, but the questions are easy as long as you pay attention in class and give the readings a brief skim! He and the TAs are very understanding in regards to making up exams. "
10,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,Amazing Professor! Very stress-free and no homework! Just three easy exams and he helps you prepare for them! I've learned a lot just by attending his lectures but attendance isn't required. He's very passionate about his work and it's appreciated. One of my favorite professors for sure!
11,5.0,1.0, SOC172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,fantastic prof and makes the class super easy but also very informational
12,5.0,3.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"Robert was so adorable, every class he would tell us about his dog, whom he named B- (he gives you the back story lol). He is super passionate about public health and REALLY respected in the field so it was a cool opportunity to learn from him. The grade is made up of only four exams, which seems scary but he gives you a study guide for each exam. "
13,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"Dr. Hummer was great! Lectures were recorded, no participation, lecture content was interesting. Only grades are the tests, so as long as you do a bit of studying with the study guide, you should be all set. Most of it is pretty self-explanatory. Readings aren't mandatory but were helpful in knowing test content."
14,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"Dr Hummer is very knowledgeable in his field and cares a lot about his students. Class is very easy, graded on 3 multiple choice exams and final. He puts lots of gimme questions in the exam and posts a study guide. No assignments and you don't really need to do the reading either. If you have a tough schedule and need an easy A gen ed this is it! "
15,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"Easiest class I have ever taken in my life. Requires 0 attendance, but Dr. Hummer is super sweet so you should go anyway. Exams are the only grade and are incredibly straightforward and easy. "
16,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"Dr. Hummer designed the readings with students in mind, so the readings were very informative, yet only took 15 minutes at most to go through. While class does get boring at times, the exams are probably the most straightforward and forgiving I've had in my entire life. I'm now minoring in Health and Society. Highly recommended as a gen ed!"
17,5.0,1.0, SOC172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,Hummer is very nice but can be boring at times as he is passionate and likes to ramble. Graded by 4 test but if u read his book and look over the slides/study guides he gives you then you will be fine.
18,5.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"Professor Hummer is the kindest professor I have had at UNC, and his lectures are both interesting and easy to follow. Your whole grade is 4 exams, but the exams are incredibly simple with lots of gimme questions. I highly recommend taking this course!"
19,5.0,1.0, SOC172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"Your grade is determined by four exams.   The exams are really easy though, and he gives sample questions and potential test topics. He's a very knowledgeable, passionate, and enthusiastic person when it comes to Public Health. "
20,4.0,1.0, SOCI172,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,HUMMER,"Graded on 3 midterms and the final, each 25% of the grade and 50 MC questions. Lectures reflected the reading and were only boring because he has a very monotonous voice. If you read his book as assigned (not hard) and go to lectures, you should do fine in this course. Definitely sparked my interest in SOCI, and now I'm minoring in health&society!"
