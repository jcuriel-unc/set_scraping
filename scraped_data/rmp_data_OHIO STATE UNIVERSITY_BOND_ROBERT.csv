1,2.0,4.0, MHSM3300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BOND,"Mr. Bonds is tough grader, he gives a 3 papers throughout the semester and a topic and even if you follow the topic he will grade like he is an English professor. He counts and deducts points even if one word is misspelled. He does not give extra credit assignments. He expects perfection right away, instead of teaching how to get there. "
2,2.0,4.0, MHSM3300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,BOND,"Professor Bonds was a very tough grader, he looks for specific answers in his assignments. He assigned multiple quizzes throughout the week and a essay with them every other week. His lectures weren't all that great either. He provides the book readings on blackboard- that was the only plus from his class."
