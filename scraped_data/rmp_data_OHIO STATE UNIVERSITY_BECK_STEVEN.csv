1,4.0,3.0, 3335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"I enjoyed this class. He posts slides on carmen, but does add more informations  during lecture. While lecture is not mandatory, I would recommend attending for the extra information. He has lots of stories that relates with the material. The test are from both lecture and books. It's not a bad class to take and has a nice curve."
2,3.0,2.0, PSYCH5681,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,I really enjoyed this class. Dr. Beck is a little disorganized but his lectures are interesting. His tests are from both the book and the lecture material and he loves testing on statistics. If you're interested in psychopathology you'll like the class. I recommend it.
3,3.0,1.0, PSYCH3335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,His statistics are a lot of times way off but you need to know them for the exams anyways.  You can get an A fairly easily if you read the book and attend class....but if you are really interested in Psychology- his class is frustrating because lecture doesn't relate to Adjustment at all.
4,1.0,4.0, PSYCH5681,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,Dr. Beck is a very nice guy who is interested in his field BUT I would caution you not to take the class. He uses outdated materials and information. If you choose to take the course make sure that you read the textbook cover to cover and write down every random statistic he says in class.
5,3.5,2.0, PSY3335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,This class is not as bad as it may seem. He is a practicing psychologist so he lectures on what he thinks is interesting and then you are responsible for what is in the book for the exam. He loves statistics so pay close attention to them while your taking book notes. He also gives a pretty big curve which helps a lot. I got an A fairly easily.
6,2.0,3.0, PSYCH3335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"The tests in this class were ridiculous, they are made up of totally random questions from the book. I found the lecture parts of the test to be quite easy, but his lectures are boring and the research is outdated. There is no new info to be learned in this class if you have already taken counseling psych and abnormal psych."
7,3.5,3.0, PSYCH335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"Dr. Beck was extremely spacey, disorganized and dull. His lectures sometimes have information that is incorrect and misleading. He relies HEAVILY on insignificant details from the book. If you read the book then that part of the test is fine, but the lecture section is ridiculous. The paper, however, was easy."
8,1.5,5.0, PSYCH681,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"Dr. Beck is really nice but I would caution everyone interested in taking his Psych 681 course. First, he lectures little to nothing from the book and you are responsible for the book and lectures on the tests (they're often opposing information). He is spacey, extremely unorganized, his tests don't make sense, & has lectured incorrect information."
9,4.0,2.0, PSYCH335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,The class was interesting and he was a pretty good lecturer. A lot of people didn't come to class but if you go to lecture and read the book thoroughly it is easy to get an A. He doesn't cover the reading in class so you have to be motivated to do it on your own. He seemed like a really nice guy and had a lot of good stories from his clinical work.
10,1.5,5.0, PSYCH681,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"He makes mistakes on his own exams, makes you choose between what he says in class and what the book says, and if that's not enough, you spend half the time trying to figure out what the questions are asking. Nice guy, but extremely spacey, making for an unreliable professor."
11,2.0,4.0, PSYCH681,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"Dr. Beck is obviously a caring man, but he is just not the best teacher. The class was unorganized and it was hard to get questions answered. You must read the book very closely! and the topics assigned for reading will be different than that discussed in lecture. The class is so frustrating it's not worth taking even if you're highly interested."
12,3.0,3.0, PSYCH335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"The class is not hard if you life cold hard stats. Half of exam comes from the book (which you never go over and is indep study) and lectures that are based on date he has found on diff. subjects. He comes off anxious and is pretty scatter-brained, unprepared. His off the cuff style does not work. 3 exams and a an easy paper. Take only if needed."
13,2.0,3.0, PSYCH681,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"This professor constantly generalizes about disorders, uses outdated research, and is super terrible at writing exams.  good luck, i would not recommend him, he needs to retire"
14,5.0,2.0, PSY335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"I just recently graduated from OSU and this was one of my favorite classes...and it was even in the early morning.  Dr. Beck had some really interesting things to say and if you went to class, he gave hints for the tests. Very intelligent, educated and fair prof.  Hightly recommended!"
15,3.0,5.0, PSYCH681,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,I like the guy but the test are tough.
16,4.0,2.0, PSYCH335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"This was my first class as a non-trad student after being out of school for 8 years. I found Dr. Beck's lectures interesting and relevant to the real world.  He uses a lot of stories which were interesting to me.  Half of the tests are from the text, so there is a lot of reading involved.  If you go to class and read the text, you can get an A."
17,4.5,4.0, PSYCH335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"Attendence is not mandatory but I would definitely recommend going, since part of the exams come from the book. Dr. Beck is an amazing professor. He knows his material and is very passionate about all of it. Lectures were very interesting. I don't get up for many 9 am classes, but I hardly ever missed his!"
18,1.0,4.0, PSY335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,No Comments
19,5.0,3.0, PSYCH335,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"This is a must to take psych class!! Dr. Beck makes an hour and 48 min seem like half an hour. His lectures are outstanding, applicable to real world, nothing obscure. But careful!His tests have a lot of stats and are long. Even so, its a well balanced class and very informative and entertaining. Overall is great, study and you can easily get an A."
20,2.0,2.0, PSYCHOFADJUST,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,BECK,"This man has no buisiness being a college proffesor. If a student asks a question which he doesn't know the answer to, he just guesses, often times wrongly. The subject matter is very easy to master, yet it is nearly impossible to get an A.  This is because his tests include many random and irrelavent statistics from the text book."
