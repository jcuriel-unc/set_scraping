1,5.0,3.0, POLI433,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"Professor Hooghe is one of the most brilliant and inspiring professors at UNC. I took POLI 433 as a first-year and was slightly apprehensive due to my lack of prior knowledge regarding the EU, but her lectures progressed in depth and were comprehensible throughout. One piece of advice- take part in the Oxford Union Debate- such a fun experience!"
2,5.0,3.0, POLI448,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"Liesbet is an excellent professor and pioneer in her field, which makes her work incredibly cerebral. The discussion in class is also extremely informative, however, if you do not have an interest in multilevel governance or the EU/IO's then this might not be your class. I would take just to meet professor Hooghe however."
3,5.0,3.0, POLI433,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"Professor Hooghe was truly one of the kindest professors I have ever met. She was understanding of my mental health issues and supported me throughout the whole semester. Her class is extremely interesting, has great lectures, and contains a few, important assignments. Shes a gem! 10/10 I would recommend a class with her."
4,4.0,3.0, POLI066,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"Professor Hooghe is an excellent professor. She cares a lot about her students understanding the material than being able to regurgitate it on a test. There are only a handful of grades. The class will seem dry in the beginning, but closer towards the end of the semester she becomes more fun and gets to know her students better."
5,4.0,3.0, POLI448,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"This class is very interesting if you want to understand multilevel governance. However, as a rather novel concept, the class is very experimental. While the grading criteria is clear, Hooghe changes due dates and assignments to be more fitting to students. She is very flexible. Sometimes her lectures are tangential, but she is very knowledgeable."
6,5.0,3.0, POLI433,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"I love Professor Hooghe! She does not always stay on topic, but her lectures are always interesting. She always posts her slides, so if you know that information, you will be set. Not many grades, but graded fairly. Very available, and always willing to help and clarify, or just chat about projects, ideas, or thoughts involving Europe or the EU."
7,3.0,1.0, POLI66,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"There were only 4 grades in this class (midterm, final and 2 in class activities) so if you mess one up it can be hard to catch up. However, she literally shows you the questions that are going to be on the test beforehand, so if you are willing to make a minimal effort you will get an A"
8,4.0,2.0, POLI66,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"Professor Hooghe is so intelligent and loves to talk about everything political science. I took her for my freshmen seminar and she was really great. We only did easy work as it was a first year class, but great overall class and relatively easy. I would definitely recommend her as she has so many accolades and was very accessible outside of class!"
9,2.0,4.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,Dr. Hooghe is a bit spacy and she talks about whatever subject she feels like talking about instead of what she's going to test on. Make sure you get a good TA if you take her. Recitation is your only chance to learn what you need for the exams. The TAs also grade the exams and some grade significantly harder than others so beware.
10,3.0,4.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"Having a good TA is key - go to the class, do the readings and you will be FINE.  I like her - she def. knows what she's talking about!!!"
11,3.0,3.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"Dull lectures with a monotone voice.  Does not know how to use a microphone.  Tests are not that bad, but everything is graded by your T.A.  If you have a tough T.A. you're screwed."
12,2.5,3.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"Boring class...most people either fall asleep or play cards on their computer. Make sure you get a good TA for this class, they will be the only ones you actually learn anything from"
13,3.5,3.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,LIESBET,HOOGHE,"A fairly interesting teacher with a neat accent.  Lectures are decent and attendance isn't mandatory but there is not textbook and no posting of the notes, so it's pretty important to come.  Tests aren't that difficult.  The main thing is to find a decent TA.  Overall a pretty interesting class, I would recommend it."
