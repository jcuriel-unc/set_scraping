1,5.0,2.0, POLISCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,ANGEL,Dr. Angel is the Best.  Recommend his American Presidency class!
2,5.0,2.0, POLISCI101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,ANGEL,Dr. Angel is extremely considerate and thorough. You know exactly what is going to happen and when it will happen. I knew when I signed up for his class that I would need to miss some days of class and he was very helpful in allowing me to make up missed work and assignments prior to leaving. Anything on tests/quizzes are discussed in class.
3,4.0,3.0, POLI101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,ANGEL,I liked taking his class but I have to say it's quite repetitive. Yeah you learn a lot but it's super boring sometimes. You can easily pass the class with an A by just using sparknotes and not reading the 2 hours of homework he wants you to do by the next lecture. But he is very knowledgeable and friendly I liked him overall just kinda boring.
4,5.0,4.0, POLI101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,ANGEL,"LOVE LOVE LOVED this class.  Dr. Angel has the ability to show his students how politics really works, and he does it with absolutely no bias. I took this class thinking that I knew how our government works, and I left the class with a genuine understanding of it.  I recommend this class to EVERYONE at OSU Lima, whether it is a requirement or not."

7,4.5,4.0, POL100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,ANGEL,"I took his honors poli sci class and it was great. He is very very interested in teaching and def knows what he is talking about. group work helps a lot with class discussion and he hands everything back with a lot of feed back. a great teacher with a lot of experiance, including his own politics book that we worked with in class, def. take him!"
8,3.5,3.0, PS100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,ANGEL,"Really knows his stuff and interested in teaching.  Don't take his class early in the day though, his voice will put you to sleep fast."
9,5.0,3.0, POLIT101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,ANGEL,"Great professor, Dr. Angel is very helpful outside of class. His lectures are very clear, and we did a lot of group work also. The group work really helped with the lectures. Make sure you read the books, because they will help you, especially on the exams. I would highly suggest taking him, he is a great professor, and the class was really good."
10,5.0,3.0, POLIT101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,ANGEL,"I actually took this class a couple years ago, but never did this.  Angel is a great prof and a good lecturer.  Hes very passionate about the subject and that rubs off on his students.  Definitely recommend this class for your GEC requirements."

13,4.0,3.0, POLISCI101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,ANGEL,interesting - but monotonic...
14,4.0,4.0, POLI165,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WILLIAM,ANGEL,Genuinely interested in teaching. A lot of class discussion; really made the class more about the students and less about himself.
