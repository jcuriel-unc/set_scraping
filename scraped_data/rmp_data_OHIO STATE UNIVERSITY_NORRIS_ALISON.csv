1,5.0,4.0, PUBHLTH7000,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ALISON,NORRIS,"This professor was absolutely amazing. If you are interested in Public Health, or in taking a class with a respectful, driven, caring, and enthusiastic professor, then take this course. I took this course right before USMLE step 1 as a medical student and it was still worth every second.  Amazing course, and really amazing professor."
