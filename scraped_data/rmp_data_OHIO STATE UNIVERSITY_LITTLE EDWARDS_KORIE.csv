1,2.0,5.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"Edwards made a mistake in my grades, I asked her about it, she said she would fix it and then never did. She also assigns massive writing assignments for no reason. Didnt feel like a learned much, she just likes assigning work."
2,5.0,5.0, SOC101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"Dr. Little Edwards is the best professor Ive ever had. She is so interesting and engaging and focuses a lot on class discussion, which I loved. I got close to many people in the class and learned a lot about them in our discussion. Dr. Little Edwards is insightful, thoughtful, and passionate. I would take any class she teaches."
3,2.0,4.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"This class stressed me out the entire semester! Your grade is based on the midterm, final, a book report, and a research project. There are a ton of reading assignments due before each class and you are expected to participate in class discussions over the readings, so be prepared to talk. This class requires a lot of work, but it's doable."
4,1.0,4.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"Ive taken many tough classes and am not afraid to work hard. prof edwards was awful. Unresponsive, no-show to scheduled office hours without communication, refused to grade on carmen so she could have more control but we did not have access to any grades until 3 weeks after the semester ended. Does not care about her students success. awful."
5,2.0,5.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"I wish I would've known to go to office hours before I failed the first exam and book report. This class is very difficult for a gen ed, but if you go to her office hours and show that you care, she will respect you and give great feedback. Exams are impossible. I worked very hard to get my C+ up to an A-. Huge research project. Lots of reading."
6,2.0,4.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"This class was way too much work for a GE. The research paper was time consuming and 30+ pages, although it helped that it was a partner project. There are opportunities for extra credit. She was slow to grade, and I was worried what my grade would be going into the final because I was missing very important grades. Not super responsive to emails."
7,3.0,4.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"I was nervous going into the class based on reviews, but it wasn't THAT bad. Reading before lecture and participating during lecture is important. Also do well on projects/papers/exams because there are only a few. Two opportunities for EC. Group research project is time consuming but manageable. Won't know your grade until after semester ends :/"
8,4.0,4.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"I was terrified going into this class because I read reviews, but Dr. Edwards was nowhere near as tough as I expected. Class is heavily based on daily readings and discussion, so definitely go to class and participate if you want a good grade. Not a lot of grades but stay on top of the work, pay attention to lectures, and study and you'll be fine."
9,1.0,4.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,Stay away!!! My final is in a week and we have THREE grades in Carmen. She rarely responds to Carmen emails and is unhelpful and unclear in what she wants. The midterm was hard and Im expecting the final to be hard. Attendance taken every day. Very little grades in Carmen and I have NO CLUE what my final grade will be (a week from the final).
10,4.0,3.0, SOCIOL1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"Dr. Edwards puts a lot of emphasis on the importance of your individual ideas (being a ""scholar""). The exams are not terrible but are based heavily off of the daily readings, which are assigned before every class. She does a good job making the class relevant and engaging. The research project is very time consuming, however."
11,2.0,4.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,This Intro Sociology course was designed to highlight the Honors distinction. A formal research project and analytical book review served as the only other grades besides a midterm and final. Dr. Edwards stressed the importance of scholarship and became irritated if the class did not actively participate.
12,2.0,5.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"She seemed to really care about the subject she was teaching and was nice enough after class, but probably the toughest grader I have ever had. Never responded to emails, didn't use Carmen for accurate grades so you'll have to wait until grades are finalized to know what you received, & reading was super excessive. Nice lady, but I don't recommend"
13,2.0,3.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"After 12 weeks, Dr. Edwards still has not posted a single grade for the class. Participation is taken for every class, and there are no grace days. Criteria for grading is unclear--the midterm was not bad, but she did not give us any hint as to what would be covered. Lots of reading and lecture heavy. Too much work for an 1100 class."
14,3.0,3.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"Honors sociology is a class that I expected to be easy, but in reality, Dr. Edwards is a very hard grader, and it was difficult to scrape by with an A-. Biggest advice: Do the extra credit presentation. You have to email her to sign up. Its on the syllabus but she won't tell you, so be ready! Also, participate a lot and go to lecture. It matters!"
15,2.0,4.0, SOC2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,My advice is stay away. Took this expecting an easy writing 2 course but ended up doing a huge research project with a ton of field work. Most unclear grading criteria in the whole world and very disorganized. Takes forever to grade stuff. Find a different writing 2 GE to take. This class shouldn't even count for it
16,3.0,4.0, SOC101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"Nothing spectacular by any means.  She is an okay professor but is somewhat uniformed about current events, which is surprising for a sociology instructor."
17,3.5,2.0, SOC1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"I really like Professor Edwards. She was very nice, helpful, and straightforward. There were a couple papers, a midterm, a final, and then a big final project that was a lot of work, but not that hard. The midterm and final were not that easy, but she didn't grade too tough on the project. I recommend this class, even as a GE."
18,2.0,4.0, SOC704,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,She doesn't grade fairly in any of her courses. It's almost like she's on a power trip with assigning students grades.
19,2.0,5.0, SOC704,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"Unfair grading, even for grad school. Only grade we had going into the final project was an activity worth 2% of our total grade. Gave no indication of our standing during the course or what was expected for the final project. Worked my butt off on 50+ page final project only to get a B."
20,2.5,5.0, SOC101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KORIE,LITTLE EDWARDS,"I agree with the comment below me. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS... UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! She makes an intro class into something it shouldn't be. So much work! Possible to get a good grade, but you have to do bogus bonus work, and a lot of it! Not to mention, you get a ticket (and a point) every time you raise your hand, ie youre treated like a baby"
