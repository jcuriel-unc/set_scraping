1,2.5,3.0, POLSC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"Nice guy, so not sure what all of the horrible comments are about! Attendance not mandatory but all exam questions are from lecture - didn't read the book once and still did well. Not the most exciting class but only meets 2 days a week and as long as you study you'll be fine. Grade comes from 2 midterms and a final. Didn't have to write any papers"
2,2.0,3.0, PSCI100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"Must read book and attend class to understand and to be able to get lecture notes, which is where the midterm questions come from. Okay class, worth 2 days a week for GEC credits if you can pay attention to lecture in class"
3,2.0,3.0, PSH531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"Liddle is a really nice guy, but this class is awful. He gets off topic far too much, and it's really a waste of time to attend lectures, but attendance is required. The final paper is all research on your own- you don't even need to do the readings. I would avoid this class if you can, extremely boring."
4,2.5,4.0, PS100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"Terrible at lectures. Really boring and veers off topic way to much to keep the class interested. Poorly organized and puts none of his things on Carmen. For a GEC class, the midterms are overly hard, and are straight essay midterms. Even more boring. I do not recommend his class at all."
5,4.5,4.0, PS100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,Pretty good!Highly recommended!
6,3.0,5.0, POLSCH215,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,Liddle is a nice guy but grades difficultly.  He assigns much work to his honors students and expects them to work accordingly.  Class excitement level is determined by students.
7,3.5,3.0, H215,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"great guy, easy to understand his classes and very easy to get along."
8,4.0,1.0, PS100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"Very nice man- let me add the course in the 3rd week with no problem.  Very friendly.  Can be a bit boring in lecture, tends to ramble on. Likes the subject a lot.  Grades are just 3 midterms which may be difficult if you miss lectures, so go to lecture and you'll be set. Lecture notes are often handouts. Easiest course i've taken at osu so far."
9,2.5,4.0, PSH531,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,Dr.Liddle is extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter..but at times there is so much info that it becomes overwhelming..generally a nice man...and VERY lingwinded..probablly becuase he loves the subject matter..first part of class was tough if you don't really have a background in the subject..but latter half of class is easy..final paper
10,3.5,2.0, POLY100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"I rather enjoy Professor Liddle's style of teaching. He gets a bit longwinded but is very knowledgeable and always willing to help. The class is interesting and not difficult by anymeans. All in all, a good experiance"
11,1.0,3.0, POLSCI100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"Can't tell what this guy is going on about.  Very interesting to talk to, but not about Political Science.  Has a lot of unrelated stories he babbles on about. I thought if I read the book I'd be OK, but it turns out he wrote the book, so those same unrelated stories are reiterated.  If you have a good TA they will tell you what to look for."
12,5.0,3.0, H215,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"Very Knowledgable, Good amount of work.. had to write a 20-25 page paper for the final. However easy grader, and if you read and do the work you should be fine"
13,4.5,5.0, INTSTUDH215,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"This course is the most work you'll ever do for a GEC, but Liddle is worth it. He's passionate about the subject and clarifies confusing texts very well. The midterm and final 20 pg. paper were tortuous, but he's an easy grader. He even cancelled some classes so we had more time to write our finals. Great course, but slackers need not apply."
14,5.0,3.0, PS100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"Come on, its a 100 level class.  Easy overall.  Great professor.  Very knowledgeable.  If you are responsible and go to lecture & recitation, as well as read the material you will do well.  If you get below a C in this class, you should probably drop out of school in general."
15,2.0,3.0, POLISCI100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"i managed to not go to a single lecture that entire quarter and got an a... i do not encourage it but it is the most boring class, he seems very smart and nicebut for freshman it is horrible, if you miss lecture be sure to memorize the notes and become buddies with your ta"
16,2.0,1.0, 100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"Classes involved me sleeping...but in order to do well on the exams you have to be at the lectures...you can't just read. Oh and that book? You can't return it...so thanks for maknig me eat 100 bucks. Understanding however, was able to reschedule exam due to friends death. Depends too much on TAs (who again can't speak english)"
17,4.0,2.0, POLISCI100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"not a very tough class. lectures can be a bit tough to stay awake through, but as long as you have an idea of the readings and go over class notes really well before tests its not bad. simple participation ups your grade too...easy"
18,3.0,3.0, POLISCI100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,Liddle was a good professor. All he requires is that you do the reading and are engaged in your resitation. I would reccomend him.
19,1.0,5.0, POLYSCI100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R. WILLIAM,LIDDLE,"VERY HARD... I purposely failed this class (didn't go to the final) so that I could take it again. I can't stand to get C's or below, so I didn't go to the final so I could use the whole ""Freshman Forgiveness"" and take it over without being penalized! He is very boring and too involved for intro cla"
