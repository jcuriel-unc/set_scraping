1,5.0,3.0, ENR5273,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NICHOLAS,BASTA,"Dr. Basta is a true asset to Ohio State.  His lectures are interesting.  He has a great sense of humor, enjoys teaching, and his experience outside of the classroom really helps you apply what your learning.  Show up for class, make note cards of the lectures, and you'll get an A.  He assigned 3 math oriented assignments and 15 half page briefs."
2,4.5,3.0, ENR5262,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,NICHOLAS,BASTA,Dr. Basta is an excellent professor.  He seems to genuinely enjoy teaching.  His lectures are interesting.  I would absolutely take him again.  The tests are taken directly from the lecture notes.  There is a little bit of math involved in the class but this is to be expected from a chemistry class. Understand logarithms. He's funny and cares.

His soil chemistry class is a difficult class, but if you come to class everyday and engage with him during lecture you will be fine. Visit him during office hours if you ever have questions and he will help you out and ease any fear you may have. "
