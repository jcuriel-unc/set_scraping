1,5.0,2.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Professor Buzinski is hands down one of the best professors at UNC! His lectures are really engaging and he does a good job of making content understandable. He is a very fair grader, offers extra credit opportunities, and has non-cumulative exams that you can do well on if you take notes and pay attention in class."
2,5.0,2.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Dr.B is clearly passionate about what he teaches and teaching in general! His lectures were long but interesting. His grading criteria was very clear, and the assignments were all very easy. On exams we were allowed to bring in an index card of notes, but if you looked over your notes you didn't need it."
3,5.0,2.0, PSYC570,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Dr. B is an amazing professor. If you ever get the chance to take one of his classes, I recommend you do it, even if you have to move around other classes. No cumulative final, bring a handwritten index card to each test, funny clip from the office at the start of the class. The work is a bit time consuming but easy and content is interesting."
4,5.0,2.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,This was one of the best psychology classes that I've taken at UNC. It wasn't a lot of work compared to some others. There was one quiz per week based on readings and one assignment per week for our project which were always easy. A lot of your grade is made up of exams but they weren't hard if you studied at all. He also offers extra credit. 
5,5.0,2.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,Buzinski teaches a great class that he makes fun and interesting. Projects and participation are both easy if you put in any effort at all. He really wants you to succeed so don't be afraid to ask questions.
6,5.0,2.0, PSYC493,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,I loved Dr. Buzinski and the Gil Internship! He's so kind and personable and genuinely wants you to succeed.
7,5.0,3.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Professor Buzinski is amazing. Class is super fun, assignments are fair. He gives you the tools to prepare and do great and it isn't hard to do that, you just have to be willing to put in a little bit of work. I'll specifically looking to take more of his classes. I absolutely recommend Dr. B."
8,5.0,2.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Fave class at UNC so far, both bc of Dr. B and because the material is so fascinating! This was by far one of the best structured courses I've ever taken. There is a good amount of work but it is easy to do well if you stay on track, and everything you learn is useful and applicable. Highly highly recommend!! "
9,5.0,3.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Dr. Buzinski is really amazing and caring professor. He is my favorite psychology professor in UNC. He is really funny and understanding. The work for PSYC260 is easy and the workload is acceptable. Exam is easy, you just need pay attention during his lectures and make some notes. I would definitely take his higher level psychology course again."
10,5.0,3.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Dr. Buzinski is an amazing teacher and a great person. If you have the chance, take any of his courses. PSYC260 had a lot of work but it wasn't really time consuming and most of it was easy. Seriously take this class if you're considering it "
11,5.0,3.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,I love Professor Buzinski! He is super nice and understanding with everything and is very quick with his emails. His class has a lot of work however it all helps with the course material and is not super time consuming. His lectures are always fun and not boring and they prepare you well for the exams.
12,5.0,4.0, PSY566,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,I've had Buzinski for 2 courses (260 & 566) and he is hands-down my favorite professor at UNC. He is passionate about what he teaches and it translates into a great learning experience. I have learned the most from his classes and he makes every class fun and educational. Highly recommend!
13,5.0,3.0, PSYC566,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,Love Dr. B... I have now had him twice (260 & 566) and he is amazing. Take any class with him you can. He expects you to know your stuff when it comes to exam time but he prepares you well
14,5.0,3.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"One of the best professors at UNC! Dr. B has engaging lectures and is always super reasonable and flexible. There is a decent amount of work that goes into the class though- a semester long project, weekly chapter readings, weekly before class material quizzes, after class quizzes. There are 3 tests which are average but the final isn't cumulative."
15,5.0,4.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Dr. B is super kind and understanding. He moved deadlines back for us a few times, and he likes to start class off with a funny YouTube clip every day. The class itself is a lot of work, and A is set at 94. It's not impossible to get an A, but you will have to put extra time into this class."
16,5.0,2.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Dr. B is the best professor I have ever had. He's funny, kind, and makes class interesting. PSYC260 does take some effort to do well, but if you just show up to class and take notes, you will do perfectly fine on exams. The class project can seem intimidating at first, but it becomes very easy. He also gives plenty of extra credit. I recommend him!"
17,5.0,3.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Hands down, Dr. B is the best professor I've had at UNC. He is so kind and understanding, and he made this class one of my favorites ever. There are weekly readings with questions, but all the info is on Quizlet. There's a group project and 3 total exams, but they aren't hard if you just watch the lectures (which are great btw)."
18,5.0,2.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,I love Buzinski!
19,4.0,4.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Dr. B is cool and kind, but his class was a lot of work (but interesting material). There was textbook reading, a 30 question quiz, a PPT lecture, an essay, and a 10 question timed quiz each week. He was willing to give extensions and accommodations if needed. Enjoyable class and a nice guy, but a lot of work!"
20,4.0,2.0, PSYC260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,STEVEN,BUZINSKI,"Dr. B is a cool dude but I wouldn't take his class unless you're okay with writing a weekly essay and reading the textbook (which was free!). The essays were low-stakes and not graded harshly at all, though. Overall, however, Dr. B is very relatable, funny, and laid-back. Tests are based on lectures, and weekly quizzes are based on textbook."
