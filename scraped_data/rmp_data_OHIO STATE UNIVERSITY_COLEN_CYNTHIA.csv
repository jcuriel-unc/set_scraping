1,2.0,5.0, SOC5629,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CYNTHIA,COLEN,"Not a great teacher. She also taught on some things with questionable scientific backing like home birth, which seemed unrelated to the class"
2,3.0,4.0, SOC5629,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CYNTHIA,COLEN,"She cares that her students learn, but she doesnt respect them. No technology during class and no chance of recovery after midterm. Exams are hard because she makes the vocabulary on the multiple choice test your IQ not your knowledge of the course. If you dont go to class and participate every day and read every reading, dont expect an A."
3,5.0,2.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CYNTHIA,COLEN,"Slides are on Carmen but you must attend class to fully understand. She goes over information that is not described in slides. This is common sense, but don't surf the net or text; she will call you out. Studying is required. Easy A or B. YUE IS AWESOME!! Don't print anything while she's teaching in recitation, that's RUDE. I felt bad for her."
4,3.5,4.0, SOC3594,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CYNTHIA,COLEN,Dr. Colon is really nice and wants to make sure that you understand. There are 4 hw assignments that take up a lot of time but are easy to get good grades on if you take the time to do the calculations correctly. Her multiple choice is killer. Her exams are what made me get a B. Attendance isn't mandatory but she's good at explaining what she means
5,5.0,4.0, SOC629,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CYNTHIA,COLEN,"I very much enjoyed her class.  There are two 5-7pg papers and a final, no midterm. She's kind of a tough grader and there are lots of readings, but I definitely recommend this professor."
6,5.0,2.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CYNTHIA,COLEN,she is great!!you do not have to be good in math to do well in her class! she gives alot of examples so that you understand. 4 assignments through out the quarter which was not bad and a midterm and a final. TAs were really helpful also!
7,3.5,3.0, SOC549,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CYNTHIA,COLEN,"class is boring but its stats so thats not her fault, seemed interesting in teaching and making sure everyone understood what she was talking about, graded a little hard but if you go to class and pay attention it shouldnt be that bad"
8,3.0,4.0, SOC629,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CYNTHIA,COLEN,"she's not super friendly, but she's not mean. there's a take-home midterm that was at least two page essays for four questions based on lectures and readings. there's tons of reading. its a good class, but she could do a lot more with it to make the class more interesting..."
