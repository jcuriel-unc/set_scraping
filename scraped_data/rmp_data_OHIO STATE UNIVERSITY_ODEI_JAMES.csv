1,1.0,5.0, PUBHBIO2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,ODEI,"The worst professor I have ever had at OSU. Couldn't care less about his students. Extremely tough grader and doesn't grade things until after the fact and the following assignment is due where you need the previous paper. I agree with the other comment, choose your mental health. I honestly don't understand how he has so many positive reviews. "
2,5.0,1.0, PUBHBIO2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,ODEI,"Dr. Odei is an *excellent* professor that truly cares about his students and his profession. He consistently makes himself available, whether it be via email or via office hours. I had quite a few issues, personal and academic and he helped me through him. My advice is to start early, ask questions, and reach out to him! "
3,3.0,4.0, PUBHBIO2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,ODEI,"A quiz per week on a video lecture online, then an activity and lab per week. Super organized. Doesn't really teach in person but somehow I learned a lot. Group project and individual paper are big parts of grade. Exams are not bad if you look at the study guides. I had 0 experience coding before this class and now I feel like I have a strong base"
4,1.0,5.0, PUBHBIO2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,ODEI,Would not recommend if you have a choice. Choose your mental health.
5,1.0,4.0, PUBHBIO2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,ODEI,"Probably the worst professor I've had at OSU. He does not seem to care about his students. Grading unclear at times. Does not respond to emails within an expected timeframe. Belittles in office hours. The actual course material was not too bad, but he makes it hard somehow. Take someone else if you can, your grade and mental health will be better."
6,5.0,4.0, 6270,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,ODEI,"Amazing professor!!! I absolutely loved taking his course. For me, it was challenging, but he is there encouraging you to find the answer for yourself. It also helps that he has a great sense of humor and I really appreciate him and what he has taught me. He is a professor who cares for his students and is very welcoming."
7,5.0,3.0, PUBHBIO2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,ODEI,"I am currently taking Dr. Odei for 2210 (online and asynch). I am amazed at what a caring professor he is, he is super quick at replying to emails and addressing concerns with the group project. He is extremely nice during office hours and his course is a lot of work but I LOVE him- not enough good things to say about him. "
8,5.0,3.0, PUBHBIO3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,ODEI,"Professor Odei is a really cool dude if you talk to him outside of class, the assignments aren't hard once you realize they all build on each other and are repetitive. Midterms and finals are open book."
9,3.0,3.0, PUBHBIO2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,ODEI,"Grading criteria unclear at times. Somewhat belittling in office hours; prepare to get talked over. Lecture due every Monday, usually 1-2 group project activities a week, and a lab due every Thursday. He's knowledgable though and will try to help you understand the concepts. The 2 exams aren't that difficult, open notes and online."
