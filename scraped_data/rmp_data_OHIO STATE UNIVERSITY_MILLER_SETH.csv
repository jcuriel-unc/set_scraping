1,4.0,2.0, PSY2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,"
This course is incredibly easy, and Quizlet will be your best friend to prepare for the exams. There are three midterms and a final."
2,2.0,4.0, PSYCH2200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,"Unlike the other sections, the exams are closed-note and in person. Personally I do not really think this is fair, as it is far easier to have notes accessible for this course- without them get ready to actually put in a good deal of work. Dr. Miller is really nice, but I would look for another section. "
3,1.0,2.0, PSYCH2200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,"Lecture is extremely boring and he speaks in this weird, robotic voice. Study guides are just lists of concepts. Asked him for help on a homework question and he was extremely unhelpful. "
4,5.0,3.0, PSY2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,Miller was the most caring professor I've ever met! He genuinely cares about all his students and will go out of his way to help you succeed. His lectures are fun and engaging and he thoroughly explains any questions we have. With that being said his exams are a but difficult because you have to remember many equations and understand all material.
5,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,"Dr. Miller is a gentleman. I almost couldn't make it to a midterm because I was stuck in another state, but he let me know we could work things out. I also didn't go to class that often but still got a good grade. As long as you put in the effort, you'll get an easy A for sure."
6,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,"SO NICE. You can tell he REALLY wants you to succeed and will do anything in his power to make that happen. Class participation is important as it lets him know what he can do to help and also shows that you're listening but he is so, so nice. He deserves professor of the year honestly"
7,5.0,2.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,He is very passionate and cares about his students and teaches in multiple teaching styles so that everyone can understand the content. There's opportunities for extra credit and resources to do well in the class. 
8,5.0,2.0, 2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,Was the sweetest man I have ever had as a teacher. Very understanding and class was great and easy. 
9,5.0,1.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,"One of the kindest people I have ever met. I don't think I've ever been more excited to attend a class than I am his. If you have him, you are blessed. He is open to literally any questions, moves at a pace that is good for everyone, and truly wants to get to know you. Truly the embodiment of a professor who is aware of mental health."
10,5.0,2.0, 2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,I had this professor for research methods and data analysis and enjoyed both of them! This is one of the best professors I have had at OSU. Professor Miller really cares about everyone and is ready to help if you have questions. The class is also really organized and super clear. Not too much homework and the tests were fair. 
11,3.0,4.0, 4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,"I was excited to take Professor Miller's class because of his good reviews but I was very let down by him. He is extremely hard to ask questions as he does not give you a straight answer to be ""fair for everyone"". I tried asking questions for clarification but it never helped me so I gave up on asking him. I wouldn't take any of his classes again."
12,5.0,3.0, PSY2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,"Awesome guy, awesome teacher, peal of professing abilities"
13,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,"GOAT in human form. I truly do not know why this professor doesn't have a perfect rating. He is knowledgeable about the content and truly cares about his students. Dr.Miller is a paragon of virtue among a sea of miserable, overworked, and on-edge professors. "
14,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,GOAT in human form. 
15,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,He TRULY cares about his students
16,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,"I was blown away by how compassionate Dr. Miller was, and by how open he was to questions. You can tell that he legitimately cares about his students and making sure that you understand the material. The class can be tricky but Dr. Miller structures lectures so that everyone has a chance to ask any questions, and he works hard to answer them."
17,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,Professor Miller is awesome! He really cares about his class and making sure everyone understand the materia thoroughly. I would 100% recommend and plan to take another class with him in the future.
18,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,professor miller is easily one of the best profs ive had at osu. he is super caring towards his students and genuinely wants nothing but success for his students. he always strives to make sure that everyone is accommodated.
19,5.0,3.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,Seth Miller is an amazing professor and you should definitely take his classes. He is extremely clear and really wants his students to succeed. Asking questions after class and taking advantage of office hours is a good resource for his classes because he is super helpful one on one. Test questions are clearly worded and he gives tons of resources.
20,4.0,2.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SETH,MILLER,"Hard to fall behind. Go to class, ask questions. Not necessary to read textbook-he covers it all in lecture. Debatable if I'd take again as it was painful to stay awake in class. Miller is so thorough I couldn't pay attention to his lengthy explanations. Not sure it's a bad thing that he covers material at snail speed though-made class very easy!"
