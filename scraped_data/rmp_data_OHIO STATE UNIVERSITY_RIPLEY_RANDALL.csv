1,4.5,2.0, POLITSCI4270,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Ripley's class is kind of a unique animal. He's unbelievably intelligent and a wealth of knowledge (although he does go on a lot of long-winded tangents), and it can be tempting to skip class, but he knows who shows up consistently and who doesn't. If you go to class almost always and act at least somewhat engaged, you'll be successful."
2,3.5,2.0, POLISCI4270,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Very boring lectures, doesn't use visual aid, grade comes down to midterm, final, research paper"
3,3.5,3.0, POLYSCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Lectures not mandatory. If you read the books you don't need to go. Such a nice and brilliant man. Long paper assigned, and is expected to be heavy in statistical data. Even if you go to lecture, buy the book. It's very hard to take notes and stay focused. Great man "
4,5.0,2.0, CONGRESS,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Ripley is an expert on Congress and highly recommended. Personable, entertaining class, and genuinely cares about his students"
5,5.0,1.0, CONGRCONG,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Dr. Ripley's course can be challenging, but he is highly supportive of students. Well worth the effort you need to put in. He is an expert on Congress."
6,4.0,4.0, PS517,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Dr. Ripley's course is very challenging, but worthwhile. He is an expert on Congress and is definitely worth the time."
7,5.0,3.0, PS517,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Doctor Ripley is an expert on Legislative Politics. The class is rigorous, but you will learn a great deal. Ripley is an excellent professor and is highly recommended."
8,3.0,3.0, PS590,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,Mr. Ripley is a really nice guy.  His style is very dry though.  I wish he would use more powerpoint or other visuals.  He lectures almost the every class of the quarter.  Not very exciting.  Had to write a long paper and had two exams in the class.
9,2.5,5.0, POLIT517,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"grades very hard, couldn't really help with the essay"
10,4.0,3.0, PS517,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Very friendly and very intelligent, but appallingly dry lectures. He reads straight from a prepared script in a monotone voice."
11,4.0,4.0, PS517,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,Very intelligent instructor who explains things thoroughly. Only three grades in the glass. Make sure you read the books!
12,3.0,4.0, POLSC517,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Lectures were a NIGHTMARE.  I could not make it through one lecture without leaving.  I literally was falling asleep by the break.  He is a very nice guy and he knows his stuff, but he is impossible to deal with in a group/lecture setting.  The exams were not hard.  PS majors should know alot of the info already.  paper was uncalled for!  17 pages!"
13,5.0,2.0, 57,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Randall Ripley did a very good job teaching the course. He is very smart and this showed in his lectures. Dr. Ripley is very passionate about legislative politics. The class is easy, though there are quite a few books (a fair amount for a 500 level class). Responds to emails very fast and is a nice person."
14,2.0,4.0, PS517,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Very difficult professor.  Grades without a curve.  Unclear about what is expected, very picky about what you write.  Gives out Cs even without explanation about what is wrong with assignment/exam.  Avoid!!"
15,2.5,2.0, POLISCI517,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"Though Prof. Ripley is an amazingly nice man, I'm not sure if I could stand to sit there for 10 weeks again. The tests and essay were easy, but lectures were not at all helpful to the class. Refers you to sections of the book and spends nearly an hour talking about what poli sci majors should already know-- the political news. nice guy but do avoid"
16,2.0,4.0, POLISCI517,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,RIPLEY,"The most boring political science class I have ever taken! He basically speed reads from the book, and takes the entire time each session. Will never answer a question straight forward. Gives you a study sheet for the midterm but expects you to remember every little detail. Avoid!!!!!!!"
