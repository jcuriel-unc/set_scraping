1,3.0,2.0, PS3280,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"Very kind, took 4285 with her last semester, definitely cares about students in and puts effort into prepping for lectures. However, she seems like she has too much on her plate. Syllabus was thrown away, class regularly cancelled, and by the time I had written the final essay, she had gotten rid of the assignment as a whole and ended the class."
2,3.0,3.0, POLITSC4285,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"Extremely nice & knowledgeable yet unorganized & all over the place. She cancels class and changes the syllabus and due dates often. Hard to figure out when assignments are due/what work for the week. She is flexible with extensions. EXTREMELY lectured based. To succeed on exams, pay attention & take notes word for word of what she says. "
3,3.0,2.0, POL4285,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"She's one of the nicest people on earth and really cares about her students. However, she is also kind of a mess of a professor. She clearly is very busy but she wasn't great with technology or planning, so the syllabus was worthless and class got cancelled a lot. Not a hard class and was sometimes very interesting. Put in some work, you'll be fine"
4,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4285,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,Prof Watson is very knowledge of welfare state politics and you would learn a lot about different welfare systems from this class. Lots of readings but manageable and she's really caring and flexible with extensions on assignments. 3 exams each worth 25% and ~15 carmen quizzes make up the rest 25%. Not a hard course but you need to put in the work.
5,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4285,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"Dr. Watson is one of the best professors I've had at OSU. She was very effective at teaching about the welfare state from a global standpoint and gave me a much deeper understanding of the welfare state here in the US, which is something I believe we all need to understand. This is one of my only classes where I genuinely enjoyed the reading."
6,2.0,2.0, POLITSC3290,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,The class isn't difficult but Prof Watson was inconsistent and unfair in her grading.
7,3.0,2.0, PS3290,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"Prof Watson is very kind and approachable. The class itself was not difficult and fairly interesting. However, it was pretty unorganized and did not stick to the syllabus whatsover. Quizzes are easy and open book and she gives you plenty of time to complete them. Exams are also lecture based and nothing out of the blue."
8,5.0,3.0, PS4280,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,Professor Watson is so clearly passionate about the topic she's teaching and it comes across during lecture. Attendance at lecture wasn't mandatory but doing the readings and going to lecture made it really easy for me come exam time. Prof Watson was very accommodating when I needed it and overall a great teacher.
9,3.0,3.0, 4285,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"She was okay. 2 midterm exams (worth 60% total 30% for each. But if you do bad on the 1st exam she will let you change the weight to 20%  40%) attendance is a part of grade and there is no final exam,there is a debate. but you get to sign up to be either a debater(no paper), brief writer (7 page paper), or judge (7 page paper). Easy class."
10,4.5,4.0, POLITSC4280,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"She gets really excited when she talks, she is great about engaging students and having discussions while staying on topic, even with 60 students. She moved back due dates a lot, which was helpful. It was great that she let us choose whether we wanted to take an exam or write a paper. We could get away with not doing all the readings."
11,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4280,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,Dr. Watson is a great professor that truly cares about students and enjoys teaching. She is highly knowledgeable and passionate about the material. She made lectures and discussion interesting and fun. This is the second course I have taken with her and I learned a great deal in both. I highly recommend taking a course with her you won't regret it!
12,4.5,2.0, 4280,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"She is a very easy grader, if you come to the lectures you don't really need to do the readings. She friendly and enthusiastic, defiantly an expert in her field. I would take her again."
13,3.0,2.0, PS4280,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,Professor is good. A is easy. And she is always there to ask your questions. But she has awful lectures . They're not coherent at all.
14,5.0,2.0, POLITSC4285,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"One of the best professor's I have encountered at OSU! She knows what she is talking about and the class is very interesting. I learned a great deal from her. She is also very helpful in office hours, cares about students, and wants you to do well. if you come to class, take notes, and read the course material there is no reason you can't succeed."
15,5.0,1.0, POLITSCI4285,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,This professor and course were great! A fair amount of reading not to much. I didnt have to purchase a text book. The professor was very knowledgable about the course and she was very helpful during office hours. there were two midterms and a debate no final. she gave study guides for both midterms. the class was an eye opener.
16,3.5,1.0, POL4285,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"Really great class, i took Welfare because i couldn't fit the class i really wanted in there but i am truly glad i took this class!  VERY eye opening class!  Sara Watson is a very great teacher who knows everything about welfare and politics in Europe.  I highly encourage this class and I highly encourage taking this teacher. 2 midterms and debate"
17,2.5,4.0, PS4285,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"If you are white, male, conservative and rich do not take this class. Prof. Watson is very nice, but has one of the most warped ideas of how the Welfare State should be run. She constantly would slam Republicans and men for the problems in society. I walked out several times from outrage over her style of teaching."
18,5.0,2.0, PS534,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,"Professor Watson has been one of my favorite professors while I have been at OSU. I took this PS class for my major but ended up really enjoying it. She doesn't take attendance, but because few people came the day before Thanksgiving, she took attendance that day and gave us extra credit. I would recommend this professor to a friend."
19,4.0,4.0, POLSC580,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,SARA,WATSON,She is very interested in making sure the students understand the topics and how they react to the studies. She is objective yet structured in her teachings. Class was fun and stimulating. I would recommend this class and teacher to a friend.
