1,5.0,4.0, SOC2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"The bad reviews are likely from people who didn't go to class and didn't put the time in. Although attendance technically isn't mandatory, you HAVE to go to class to get the notes and content. She is an amazing professor- her lectures are great and she is very eager to help. Very sweet lady. Put the time in, and you will get a good grade! "
2,4.0,4.0, SOC3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"I thought this class was really interesting, and Deb did a great job making it fun and engaging. I won't lie, this is one of the hardest classes I've taken at OSU, and Deb is a really strict grader. You have three assignments, quizzes, and tests for the entire semester so you basically have to do well on all of them if you want a good grade. "
3,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"I love Prof. Wilson, and she is my favorite professor at osu. She is an engaging lecturer and very knowledgeable. Those who say that the class is too difficult are definitely first semester freshman who don't how college works yet or people who want gimme A's. The class takes a little (emphasis on little) effort but is so worth it."
4,5.0,3.0, 2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"I loved Deb so much. This class was not easy, but it was so interesting. You will have to put in a lot of work, but because of Deb I fell in love with the content and wanted to do the work. I actually changed my major only a few weeks after taking this course, it's amazing. Deb is probably my favorite professor I have ever had. "
5,5.0,5.0, 3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"Dr. Wilson is not the professor you want to take for an easy A, but if you genuinely want to learn, she is perfect. Her lectures were never boring. This class is a lot of work and I would not recommend going in expecting an A because you'll likely be disappointed, but the amount I learned from this class made it so worth it!"
6,5.0,3.0, 2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"I absolutely loved Dr. Wilson. Her lectures were interesting and engaging, but the class is graded by few things. However, if you go to class, take good notes, and put in effort on the homeworks/tests/quizzes you will do good. She cares about her students and is always willing to answer any questions I have. She is one of the best teachers/profs."
7,5.0,4.0, 2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"Do not be fooled by the other reviews. Deb is an incredible professor and gets a bad rap from kids who are not willing to put in the work to do well in her class. Go to class, take good notes, don't wait until the last minute to study or do the homework and you will do fine. She truly is one of the best professors in the sociology department."
8,2.0,5.0, SOC2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"The fact that this is an ""intro"" class is incredibly misleading. This was by far the most difficult class I've taken to date. Her lecture slides are basically useless, so you have to pay attention to every single word she says or you might miss something. Grades EXTREMELY hard on homework assignments and quizzes. Honestly, steer clear at all costs."
9,1.0,5.0, 2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,By far the worst professor for an intro class. Exams and quizzes don't match the presentations and lectures. Avoid her at all cost.
10,4.0,3.0, SOCIOL2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"Professor Wilson was a great teacher. She is highly knowledgeable and enthusiastic during her lectures and seems to be very down to earth. However, if you are taking this class, please do not discount the homework assignment and quizzes. She is a tough grader, and lecture is not mandatory, it is highly recommended! Do the assigned readings! "
11,4.0,4.0, 2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,Professor Wilson is knowledgeable on what she is teaching. The lectures will keep you interested and you will be able to tell that she knows what she is talking about. The issue that many people did have is that the course was too difficult for a 2000 level course. There was just a few assignments to be graded on and expected to know so much.
12,4.0,4.0, 2209SOC,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"She is very knowledgeable on the topic and does a great job of explaining concepts. However, every class is a lecture and you cannot afford to miss one because she does not post them. I liked the class overall and would take it again, but thought it was a little difficult for an intro class. "
13,5.0,4.0, SOC2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"The class is lecture heavy, however I found myself always very engaged. She's a great lecturer. I emailed her a question once and she emailed me back super quick with so much information and then came up to me in class the next day to make sure I fully understood. She cares a lot about what she is teaching and it shows! Loved this class."
14,1.0,5.0, SOC,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,Half of these reviews sound like they were written by the professor and do not match the reality of her teaching style/class experience. She also gets unfavorable reviews taken down so beware. 
15,5.0,4.0, SOC3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"Hands down the best prof. Cares that her students understand the material, swears like a sailor, and puts 110% into every class. Midway through a class Melissa Shivers came in and congratulated her with a $5000 bonus and an induction to some prestigious teaching society, she's the real deal. Come to every lecture or fail, don't slack"
16,5.0,4.0, 2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"I love her and her class so much. It's easy to get bored with some of these topics, but she really cares about what she's talking about and makes lectures interesting. It is a tough class, but if you enjoy the content and know what you're talking about then the quizzes are not bad and the homeworks are even easier. "
17,2.0,4.0, 2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"Prides herself on how nit-picky she scores assignments and on how many students fail her course. She doesnâ€™t upload lecture slides nor offer zoom if ill. She is very performative during her ego-filled lectures. On the first day of class, make sure you like your seat because she makes those seats the assigned seats for the rest of the semester."
18,5.0,4.0, SOCIOL2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"Dr. Wilson is by far the best professor I've had at OSU. Very knowledgable of the topic and every lecture is well prepared. She also spends time getting to know each of her students. Definitely a tough course and you really have to put in the efforts outside of class, but A is possible."
19,1.0,4.0, SOC3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,Grades so hard it doesnt even matter if you know the material
20,3.0,5.0, SOCIOL2209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DEBORAH,WILSON,"Though I think Deborah is a good professor, I think she makes the class way too difficult for an intro class. Theres only 3 hws 3 tests and 3 quizzes that count for your grade and nothing else. If you bomb one test theres practically nothing else to get your grade back up. tests are based on lectures and they arent posted. I barely passed"
