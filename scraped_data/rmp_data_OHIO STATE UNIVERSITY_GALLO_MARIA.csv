1,2.0,3.0, 6431,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIA,GALLO,Dr. Gallo is not patient or inviting when it comes to students questions. She responds in quite a defensive and irritated manner. She is also very contradictory. She says she is not trying to trick you and writes her tests/assignments in a very technical way. 
2,5.0,4.0, 6431,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIA,GALLO,"She is a tough grader, but she intends well. She wants to make sure youâ€™re prepared and that you know your material. The book for the class is arduous, but her lectures really help concepts come to life and the homeworks help make those concepts more concrete. I would highly recommend her!"
