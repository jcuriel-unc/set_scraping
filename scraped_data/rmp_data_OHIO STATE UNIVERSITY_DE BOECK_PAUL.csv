1,2.0,2.0, 4511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,DE BOECK,"This class was wild. There is no structure, lectures are all over the place and it is so disorganized. Definitely an easy A if you just go to class. You have a confusing quiz once a week, 3 homework assignments, and a presentation, but if you go to class he basically gives all the answers. He is pretty funny but I retained nothing from this class. "
