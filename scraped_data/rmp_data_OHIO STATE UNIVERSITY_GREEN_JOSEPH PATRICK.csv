1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH PATRICK,GREEN,Dr. Green was a great prof and I would be ecstatic to have him as a prof again. Exams are heavily based on lectures! While attendance is not mandatory I definitely think having good attendance is what helped me the most to be successful in the class.

4,4.5,2.0, PSYCH331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH PATRICK,GREEN,I've taken a lot of Psych classes with Dr Green because he is one of the best instructors. He is really helpful and makes things relate to you. He's really interesting and genuinely enjoys teaching.
5,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH PATRICK,GREEN,He teaches the material in a fun and relate-able way. He's one of those professors who make the class more than a lecture then an exam. He gets involved which makes the content interesting. It's one of the few classes I truly look forward going to during the week.
6,5.0,2.0, PSYCH551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH PATRICK,GREEN,"I took this class over the summer, and it was only 6 weeks long.  There was a lot of material to cover, but Dr. Green made it very easy to understand.  He gives study guides for the test, and if you thoroughly study the things listed, you will get an A. I recommend going to every class, as most of the test material is taken directly from lectures."
7,5.0,3.0, PSYCH551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH PATRICK,GREEN,"Awesome Prof.  Didn't know what I was getting into, but it turned out well. Dr. Green is easy to understand and very helpful. STUDYING is required to get a good grade, but he gives info all about the exams beforehand."

9,4.5,2.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOSEPH PATRICK,GREEN,"Showing up for class isn't mandatory, but its a good idea; he goes over a lot of stuff in class and makes things a lot easier to understand.  Exams are important, so STUDY, but he's pretty generous about curves."
