1,5.0,1.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"This class was extraordinary!  Definitely one of the best classes to take at UNC!  Very eye-opening and inspiring.  Class was structured well.  Reading quizzes can be hit or miss, but they're open note and mostly easy.  Short essays were graded easily, and the final term paper was not bad.  Final exam was basically a mix of old reading quizzes."
2,5.0,2.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"Your grade is composed of weekly quizzes, recitation attendance and participation, attendance at speaker series (unc brought wrongfully convicted speakers for our class to hear) 4 short essays that were basically easy 100's, a final exam that was just the weekly quiz questions and a 7 page final paper. Overall 10/10 class, everyone should take it"
3,5.0,2.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,I've loved my classes with Frank Baumgartner! He is super passionate about this class and cares more that we learn something rather than worrying about how to test us. Speaker series was interesting even though they were long and in the evening. His quizzes were exactly from the readings. TA grades papers and recitation attendance is mandatory.
4,5.0,2.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"Best class I've taken so far. The material is very important and Prof. Baumgartner delivers it well -- he really knows what he's talking about. And even though the subject matter is dark, it's still a fun class bc of his personality. There is an AMAZING guest speaker series w/ wrongfully convicted people. Homework isn't bad. 100% recommend!"
5,4.0,1.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"Really committed and passionate professor about the wrongs of the death penalty, but due to the structure of the large lecture, taught mostly by slides which was not engaging. Not a hard class, graded by lots of things, material isn't hard at all. "
6,5.0,2.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"Fbaum became a sort of cult legend in our class. He's funny, knowledgable, and structured. Some of the ideological bent did come through during the semester and little time is spent on victims or crimes, but the class was largely fascinating statistics and interesting anecdotes. A great way to get your US and SS credits. TAKE IT."
7,5.0,3.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"I was hesitant to take this class because I had no interest in poli sci, but this class is extremely interesting and illuminating about the death penalty in the US. It is one of the best classes you can take at Carolina. Baumgartner is an amazing professor as well. Take this! "
8,5.0,2.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,Fbaum is awesome! I love this class and am learning so much. This class is awesome and will be unforgettable. I think everyone should take this class. I would take any classes taught by Fbaum. You can't go wrong here!
9,5.0,3.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"Life changing class and amazing professor. Important content that Frank makes very accessible to engage with, think about, and reflect. I recommend this class 1000% to any philosophy/political science major, or just any student in general who wants to dive into criminal justice."
10,5.0,3.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,Frank is the coolest guy ever. I have taken 2 of his classes and he is so awesome. I have really learned a lot from him.
11,5.0,2.0, POLI248,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"This was my second class with Dr. Baumgartner and he was great. Our class time was cut short due to unforeseen circumstances, but he was passionate about what he taught, knowledgeable, and understanding. He was always responsive to emails and questions. 10/10 would recommend taking a class with him if you get the chance!"
12,5.0,2.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"Frank is amazing. He is so intelligent, gives assignments that are actually relevant, and is an awesome guy overall. I would take a class with him anytime again"
13,5.0,3.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"I wasn't particularly impressed with his lectures but the speakers he invites make the class unforgettable. Having the opportunity to visit central prison and see death row for yourself is a life changing experience. The class itself isn't that difficult, but it is graded on only a few things and missing recitation or evening events will hurt you."
14,5.0,3.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"Prof. Baumgartner's class on the death penalty was life-changing. I took his class a few years ago and I still talk about it all the time to anyone who will listen. POLI203 was far the most profound and interesting class I took at Carolina. While attendance was not mandatory, I never missed a class. Thank you, Prof. Baumgartner."
15,5.0,2.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"This class is amazing. I came in not really having a clear stance on the death penalty, but left with tons of evidence steering me to one side. There are evening lectures, but the speakers are so interesting, plus the class is 4 credits (and a pretty easy A). Lectures are a bit boring at times, but not mandatory. Assignments aren't graded harshly."
16,5.0,3.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"The lectures and speakers for this class were life changing. I will never look at criminal justice in the same way again. Not a super difficult class but truly inspirational. There is a lot of reading but Baumgartner really knows this topic, and the speakers he invites are incredible. Everyone should take Poli 203 its truly an amazing class!"
17,5.0,3.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"Professor Baumgartner is very passionate about what he teaches. His classes comprise of almost all lecture, but they are interesting. He more or less reads off the slides but they are posted online so not always necessary to attend class. Your grade depends mostly on the TA, but most are nice. Get ready to read and remember general trends."
18,5.0,3.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"Frank is one of the best professors I have ever had at UNC. He is a fantastic teacher and just an overall great guy. This class itself was awesome. Attendance not mandatory but is so interesting you won't want to skip. The class is graded by TA's, but they aren't too difficult. I recommend everyone take this class, the speakers were amazing."
19,5.0,2.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"Prof. Baumgartner is truly the best professor I've had at UNC. He is extremely knowledgable, witty, and genuinely cares about his students. Poli 203 with him was truly life-changing. We were graded on six 10-question quizzes, 2 papers, recitation, and final. Paper grades depend on your TA, though. Take any class you can with Baumgartner!!"
20,5.0,4.0, POLI203,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,FRANK,BAUMGARTNER,"The content and opportunities with this class are unmatched. Baumgartner is amazing and receptive to students, even with a 400 person lecture. I will say though that a lot of the information is number and small details, which you are expected to know for the final. Paper grading depends on TA."
