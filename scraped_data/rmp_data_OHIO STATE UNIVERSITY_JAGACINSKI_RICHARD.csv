1,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,Prof. Jagacinski is nice guy and fun to talk with. Really learned a lot from his class.
2,2.0,4.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"This class is supposed to be a basic psych requirement but I struggled a lot. He hands out notes but he leaves A LOT out so they don't make sense and he doesn't post any notes online. Pop quizzes, one midterm and a cumulative final so there are not many points. He is super nice but I would not recommend taking his class."
3,1.0,4.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"This is a class I'm assuming is supposed to be easy going and basic. His lectures have little if any relevance to the text book making it confusing to refer between the two for the tests. He wastes an unbelievable amount of paper, printing out his slides (which do not make sense even when explained). 0 study guide material, small amount of grades."
4,2.5,3.0, PSYCH2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"I'm in his class at the moment. I have tried so hard to pay attention, but I am confident that it is impossible. Painfully boring."
5,5.0,1.0, PSYCHA,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,Excellent teacher.  Enjoys and knows his subject matter.  Friendly and helpful.
6,4.5,4.0, PSYCH597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"Though it's been nearly 5 years, I often refer to what I learned in this class in discussions with colleagues."
7,5.0,1.0, PSY597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"Richard is smart.  Pay attention.  You might learn something.  Actually, he is quite brilliant.  He enjoys his work, and is generally interested in progress of the students."
8,4.0,1.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"His lectures were boring, but he gave us handouts to follow along with, so that was helpful. He has 2 paper (easy), 4 quizzes (easy) and two test (moderately easy. I think I would take his class again."
9,2.0,4.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"His ""slides"" were incomprehensible. There were about 4 total grades in the class. It was boring."
10,1.5,4.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"Dr. Jagacinski was a very poor teacher. He never taught anything and his lectures were boring. Also, there are not many points in the class so it is easy to go down a letter grade and his midterms are pretty hard"
11,1.0,5.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,Didn't teach us anything. Boring.
12,1.5,4.0, PSYCH597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"Spends entire 2-hour lecture posting random graphs and charts with no flow or purpose. Very hard to follow or understand, and overheads are hard to see. I expected a lot from the course, but was disappointed to see how he teaches. I haven't had his exam yet, but I'm not very optimistic given how he presents the material. Course packet's unorganized"
13,2.5,4.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"Oh boy.  Dr. Jagacinski is a really nice guy, and it is obvious he knows this material well.  That being said, even he is not excited about the material.  Add to that, he teaches off of an ancient projector that forces one to be at the front of the lecture hall, it equals a pretty dull class.  Attendance is mandatory because he gives 4 pop quizzes."
14,1.5,5.0, PSYCH309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"TERRIBLE!!!! DONT TAKE with him!! He is a nice person, but his lectures were unbearably boring. The information is incredibly hard to understand from him. All he uses are graphs. It is just graph after graph after graph. Seriously consider a different class or teacher!!"
15,3.0,4.0, PSY309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"Dr. J. is a nice enough guy, who certainly knows his stuff but not all people were meant to be teachers.  Several times he disgustedly woke people up who were sleeping in class.  Sure that's disrespectful of the student, but his monotonous droning and old fashioned overheads are somewhat responsible."
16,1.0,5.0, PSYCH309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"If you want to take a good nap, take his class."
17,4.0,4.0, PSYCH309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,He's a very nice guy who definitely wants his students to understand the material. This class is difficult and you have to read and completely understand the text (which is dry) in order to do well on the test but he is willing to help you and will explain the material until you understand if you go to his office hours. I would recommend.
18,1.0,5.0, PSYCH309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,Very difficult and hard. Boring
19,3.5,2.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"Dry sense of humor. Attendence is a MUST!! He gives 4 pop-quizzes. Lectures weren't very exciting, he uses overheads straight from the textbook. Dr. Jagacinski is very informative. Mid-term and final were difficult but do-able. It is best to read the textbook before class"
20,4.0,4.0, PSYCH300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RICHARD,JAGACINSKI,"dry/goofy sense of humor that I liked; lectures were informative although material itself wasnt always very interesting; genuinely nice person- you can tell he is brilliant, but if you want extra help you will need to be proactive about it; make sure you show up to class!"
