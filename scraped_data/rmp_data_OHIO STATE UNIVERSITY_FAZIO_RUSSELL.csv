1,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4518,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RUSSELL,FAZIO,"This is actually the most interesting class I have taken in OSU. If you are really into social psych, you would like this class. There's no assignments, so final grade is only dependent on exams, which are hard but the grade is curved according to the ranking. Attendance is not mandatory but super helpful if you want to get a good grade."
2,2.0,3.0, PSYCH4518,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RUSSELL,FAZIO,This was the most boring class I have even taken at Ohio State. If you are a psychology major I recommend taking ANY other class as your upper level class. Theres only 3 exams that count towards your grade and thats it. It wasn't too hard just honestly SO SO SO boring
3,5.0,2.0, PSY4518,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RUSSELL,FAZIO,"I agree that class average was a D on every test, but a curve makes it a B-. All you need to do to do well is show up to class and take notes on the research he discusses. He is a great, knowledgable professor. He even admitted he makes the tests hard because it's an advanced class, but he curves greatly. don't blame a poff because you don't study!"
4,1.0,5.0, PSYCH4518,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RUSSELL,FAZIO,Good luck passing this class. Averages on the exams are D's. Hardest class I've ever taken and he makes his tests unpassable. Do not take this course!!!
