1,3.0,3.0, STAT3470,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MATTHEW,WASCHER,Matthew is the median of all professors. He doesn't really care if you show up to lecture but he also isn't that great of a lecturer. He sometimes treats people like they are idiots for not understanding a concept but he does go over it again. Midterms were standardized and he wrote generally the toughest questions.
2,4.0,3.0, STAT3470,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MATTHEW,WASCHER,"Good option for 3470. He lectures via writing on powerpoints, which he uploads after. Lecture is not mandatory but I went to them all. He's pretty funny and lectures are quality, but he sometimes flew through slides so it was hard to take notes. He did improve on this though. WebAssign sucked but 10% added to HW grade. Overall, I really liked him."
