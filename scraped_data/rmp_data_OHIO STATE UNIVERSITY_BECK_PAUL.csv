1,3.0,4.0, POLITSC4150,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"Prof. Beck's course is largely statistical and focuses on the kinda stuff most political science students probably already know (at least in a loose sense). As such, lectures are quite boring and most of the information can be gathered from skimming the slides he provides. He's terribly dry but very smart, so you can't really help but respect him."
2,4.5,1.0, 4150,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"He's a great professor.  The lectures are dull and sooooo long, and you'll definitely fall asleep.  He really knows what he's talking about, though, and you really have no excuse for not doing well if you show up.  Lots of readings, but skimming them is more than enough."
3,5.0,3.0, PS4150,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,Great teacher
4,5.0,3.0, AMPOLPARTY,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"Mr.Beck is a great teacher who knows his stuff. He is liberal(check fec.gov for who he's donated to) but does a great job hiding it. DO THE READINGS.the exams are multiple choice/essay. he gives the possible 6 essay questions in advance. My advice would be to draft the essays out in advance after doing readings,so that you're not doing the night B4"
5,5.0,2.0, PS4150,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"Amazing professor! Creates a great balance between professionalism and fun (humor) in the classroom. Material is very relevant to current affairs. He's always very accessible, and is always willing to help. He's a Prof. Emeritus, so take a class with him while he's still at the University!"
6,4.5,2.0, PLSCI101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"Dr. Beck is extremely passionate about the field of Political Science and is very knowledgable about the subject matter. Yes he does tend to stray off topic, but the majority of his lectures are interesting and informative. He references the books and they are extremely helpful to study for the midterms with."
7,4.0,3.0, POL575,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"Mr. Beck is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about political parties. He is a great teacher, but sometimes his lectures can be a bit dry, boring, and repetitive. The two exams he gives are 25 multiple choice questions each with a long essay response as well. He also has you do a research paper that makes up a big portion of your grade."
8,5.0,3.0, POISC300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,Professor Beck is incredibly well knowledge and generally a nice person. I highly recommend him.
9,4.5,2.0, POLS575,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"Really great professor, one of the best I've ever had. Very friendly and communicates really well with the students. The class wasn't too challenging but wasn't easy, and I learned a lot. Highly recommended."
10,5.0,1.0, PSCI101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"Awesome guy. Class is easy and he really knows his stuff. Always gives you room to voice your opinion, and grades you not on your opinion, but how you back it up and how well you know the material. Exams are straightforward and simple and he puts in a lot of cool stories and opinion pieces in his lectures. Definitely recommend him."
11,5.0,3.0, PS575,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"Prof Beck is a really great teacher. Helpful with anything you could ever need help with. Instant responses to emails, go out of his way for office hours etc. Lecture can be boring at times, but a lot of political anecdotes. Paper is fairly easy and exams are straight forward. Gives you essays ahead of time to study."
12,5.0,2.0, POLSC575,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"Great teacher.  Clearly knew the topic, researched any questions he did not know the answer to.  Grades very fairly, the essay was easy to get a good grade on.  Attendance not required, but can be used to bump grade up if you are close.  Overall great teacher, if you have the option, take him!"
13,4.5,2.0, PS585,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"Professor Beck is a good guy. His class is easy, but you learn a lot. I thought the material was interesting - and you could see that he enjoyed teaching it."
14,5.0,1.0, POLYSCI575,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,BECK,"Dean Beck is a good teacher. He is very informative and does a great job relating the topics to more recent elections. The class can get boring at times, but it is very interesting. The class is not too difficult and the paper topic is very interesting."
