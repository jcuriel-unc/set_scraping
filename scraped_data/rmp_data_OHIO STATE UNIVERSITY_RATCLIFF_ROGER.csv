He'll put a whole slide of computations and just show you the end result but not actually explain too much of how he got it.  I hope you have a prior knowledge of Stats before taking his class."
2,4.0,3.0, PSYCH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"You don't need the book but you must go to lecture, the online homework is pretty hard but the exams are easy, you get to take a cheat sheet with you to the exams. You also must have the notes for class because he talks way too fast to just write them down. He's a great teacher, the homework, is just difficult."
3,3.0,3.0, PSYCH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"Witty prof from New Zealand. You don't need to get the book, but you have to go to lecture. Office hours with the TA's saved my life. You have to do online quizzes every week that can be pretty tricky so find a buddy to check answers with! He lets you have an equation sheet but study for exams! I ended up getting an A- and I hate any type of math."
4,2.0,4.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,This guy is witty and knows his stuff but should NOT be teaching an intro level class. Flew through slides and the homework is ridiculously hard.
5,1.5,3.0, PSYCH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"This class is awful. Though he can be entertaining, he cares not about your grade or your comprehension of the material. The homework is outrageously more difficult than the exams. He flies through the material ppts. which are OFTEN riddled with typos, which is very unsettling when trying to learn math."
6,4.0,4.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,great teacher
7,3.5,3.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"This class was kind of boring. The Prof was funny though and tried to make the material funny and interesting. You don't use the book much (unless you miss lecture) he even tells you not to buy it if you don't want to. His humor adds to his lecture, which is about an hour shorter than the schedule says, but he goes through slides really fast!"
8,3.5,2.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"He is funny; his New Zealand accent and humor were entertaining. He is willing to help, but has trouble dumbing down the material. Also, he at times gives leeway on hard cut-offs for rejecting the null hypothesis, which is confusing. I highly recommend asking your TA(s) for help if you need it."
9,4.5,2.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,AMAZING teacher. He was funny and down to earth. Highly recommended.
10,2.0,1.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"homework if anything is what brings down your grade. his midterms are pretty much the EXACT same questions as the ones he presents during the reviews, just write those problems on your cheat sheet and you're pretty much set. easy professor, kind of a mess, DON'T TAKE IT if you don't have to."
11,4.5,4.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"Dr. Ratcliff is AWESOME.The course material is pretty difficult. He moves fast through slides, but fortunately does plenty of examples and always reviews before new stuff is introduced. ASK HIM QUESTIONS! He is really good about explaining stuff. TA's quality varies. Make sure you establish a relationship right away it is beneficial. Lots of HW."
12,2.0,5.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"This class is impossible and useless if you do not know anything about statistics. It is supposed to be an introductory class but treats it like an upper-level stats course. He goes through slides too fast and even though they're available through carmen, they're useless if you don't know how to interpret them."
13,1.0,5.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"Very boring material and he is really confusing to listen to. If you don't know too much about stats.. he's not going to teach you the basics. He assumes you already know a lot. The material is so dry. He tries to slip some jokes into the lectures.. but it's just painfully boring. Only one of the TA's were helpful, still impossible though."
14,1.5,5.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"This class is terrible.  Ratcliff, while nice and quirky, does not understand that not everyone understands stats the way he does.  I've taken two other stats class and this one, which covered the same stuff, made it impossible.  He should not be teaching this low of a class.  Plus, the TA's were terrible.  Its a good class to have, but not with hi"
15,4.0,3.0, PSY320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"Professor Ratcliff was an extremely enjoyable professor who made statistics a much more enjoyable class. He involved himself in the class, and despite initial glitches in the class (CARMEN) maintained a sense of humor. His exams are straight forward IF you pay attention."
16,4.5,3.0, PSYCH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,RATCLIFF,"psych 320 is harder than regular stats, but prof. ratcliff put the notes online, always explained things carefully, and even had a low key quirky sense of humor. he made a boring subject enjoyable and spent plenty of class time working us through problems that would be on the tests - super helpful!!"
