You have a ton of time to finish each module and can honestly get it all done on the due date if you really want to. The course content is interesting and definitely important, and the discussion posts on the content are interesting. If you have a pulse and at least two brain cells, you will get an A in this class."

3,5.0,1.0, PUBHEHS5320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,QINGHUA,SUN,Dr. Sun is amazing and it is very evident that he cares! Take PUBHEHS 5320 online with him!! His class is an easy A if you do your assignments. There are 4 modules and you just have to turn in all the assignments by the module due date so you can pace on your own. Dr. Sun also gives a lot of extra credit! I have over a 100% in his class!
4,5.0,2.0, PUBHEHS5320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,QINGHUA,SUN,"Great, easy class for undergrads. Lots of notes and quizzes, but easy. Keep in mind old quiz questions when taking final exam. Discussion boards, movie tests, and final paper very graded on participation. No textbook. Worst part was he turned off the final grade on carmen so you don't know your grade or ""what-if"""
