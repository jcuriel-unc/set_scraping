1,5.0,3.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"Dr. Downey is an all around amazing professor. He does assign a decent amount of reading, but not more than other Sociology classes I have taken, and the readings are interesting. The lectures are super interesting and he incorporates activities into them. There was a group project, but it wasn't too difficult. Overall very helpful and caring. "
2,4.0,3.0, 1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"He's really entertaining and a good lecturer, he keeps you engaged. My only issue is that he doesn't give a rubric for any of his exams. However, you can email him and set up office hours to go through your essay prompts and he will give good feedback. There are 3 exams, and he gives 10 prompts for each in advance. Prepare well and you'll be fine."
3,5.0,3.0, 1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"It's clear that Dr. Downey is genuinely interested in the material. And not only does he want us to learn from him, but he wants to learn from us too. It was a very comfortable and inclusive environment for intellectually stimulating conversation and I learned a lot. Had weekly 2 question quizzes, 1 group project, 1 paper, and 3 exams. Great class!"
4,2.0,4.0, 1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,He doesn't give students feedback on exams and his rubric is based on what he thinks was important for the readings. Almost impossible to improve in this class. He talks about his favorite things about the class at the end of the semester and mentions some students by name and not others.
5,2.0,4.0, 1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"This class is not worth the amount of work he assigns. Every week you have to read two thirty-page academic papers and 4 or five book chapters. For exams, he gives you ten essay prompts based on these papers. you have to prepare your evidence for all of them and he'll ask for two. You basically have to write 30 essays for this class. "
6,3.0,4.0, 1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,you will learn a lot of new things; however this class is not easy to get an A in at all. You can only loose 75 points to still get an A-. All exams are essays with no rubric or guidlines. There are ALOT of reading and weekly quizzes about these readings. I have friends who took this class with a different prof and said it was way easier.
7,5.0,4.0, 1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"Professor Downey is very passionate about the material and it shows in his lectures. Very interesting content but should attend class if you want to do well on the exams. If you take good notes, preparing for the essay exams is easy. There is a fair amount of outside work to do for this class but it was all interesting and informative."
8,3.0,4.0, 1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"This class is not an easy A for a gen ed. He is a harsh grader, but only because he wants you to learn. Content is interesting, but there is a ton of outside work. Go to class because there are pop quizzes that are 20% if your grade on the homework readings. You have to try hard in this class to do well and one grade can offset your entire grade"
9,1.0,4.0, 1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,If you have the option to take a different GE or 1101H with a different professor take it! The exams are only essays and he gives you the prompts ahead of time. He is a very very harsh grader. There is no rubric and hes okay with giving a large amount of the class Cs and Ds. Dont take this class if youre expecting an easy A.
10,5.0,4.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"Dr. Downey is an amazing professor and extremely caring! The only bad part of his class was the harsh attendance policy - no makeups, even if you were sick and have a doctor's note. He was a thoroughly engaging professor with a strong passion for sociology."
11,4.0,3.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"Took this class to fulfill an honors GE. Requires A LOT of outside reading, & exams are in class essays. A little disappointed that I received a B in this class (was looking for an easy GPA booster) but did not regret the time I spent in the class. He's really passionate about the topics and cares for his students! Learned a lot."
12,5.0,3.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"Dr. Downey is a great professor who makes the subject very interesting both through what he talks about in class and the setup of the course. Lots of interaction with peers. You have to go to class everyday and do the readings, which are a lot, but the class itself is not too hard."
13,5.0,3.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"Dr. Downey is awesome. He is passionate about the material and his student's success. He makes a real effort to get to know everyone in the class and to offer constructive feedback. The class requires a lot of reading, but it is specific books that Downey picks out, all of which are pretty interesting. I really enjoyed this class and learned a ton."
14,5.0,4.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,Downey is THE MAN. One of my favorite professors here at Ohio State. Truly cares about his students and made the subject super interesting. Tests are challenging but he gives you the essay prompts before the exam.
15,5.0,4.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"Dr. Downey was one of the best professors I've had at Ohio State. His lectures really made me care about sociological topics and changed my worldview. His tests are pretty tough, but if you take the time to prepare for them (and meet with him to review your preparation), you'll get an A. Buy or rent the books, as the test is based on them."
16,3.5,4.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"While learning the content was interesting, when it came to the exams he was a tough grader. He gives you ten possible topics for essays relevant to the recent material, and then chooses two for you to write essays on for the exam. He really expects you to make them quality essays, so it wasn't as easy as I expected."
17,5.0,3.0, 1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"He was a fantastic teacher and really made me learn to love sociology! There is a good deal of reading in the class, and pop quizzes, but the pop quizzes are always just ""give me the main theme or summary"" so they aren't too specific. Overall, Dr. Downey is a great guy, and also a hilarious lecturer. He made going to class worth it."
18,5.0,4.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,"Professor Downey was one of my favorite professors that I have ever had.  He is very entertaining, and makes the topic more interesting than it actually is.  He is a fair grader, but you do definitely have to work for a good grade. He is not intimidating and always there to help. Definitely take his class if you get a chance!"
19,4.0,3.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,Favorite college class. He really knows his stuff & is super passionate. He presents the information in an interesting way that makes you want to pay attention. There is a lot of group work & you actually get to know the people in the class which made it more fun. Just do the reading & pay attention. Exams aren't bad if you put in the effort
20,4.5,3.0, SOC1101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DOUGLAS,DOWNEY,Dr. Downey is one of my favorite instructors of all the teachers I have ever had. He's a character and says something that makes the entire class laugh every 5 minutes. Truly enjoyed his class. He assigns really long reading assignments for homework that can be pretty unbearable but you have to do them to pass quizzes and exams. Take his class.
