1,1.0,4.0, HUMNNTR4504,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLARA,MILLER,Professor Miller was a tough grader and made her exams very confusing. She would also gaslight her students into thinking they were not studying enough when in reality her questions were worded poorly. She is passive aggressive and rude and would curve exams without letting us know so there was no way in knowing if you were getting the info better.
2,1.0,5.0, HUMNNTR4504,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLARA,MILLER,"Asks for feedback and then is argumentative. Does not listen to important class issues. Issues with the clarity of exam questions. Exam questions can sometimes be ambiguous. Arbitrarily curves exams. Was rude to a student asking for clarity on how to study for the exam by responding with ""WOW, why don't we just learn the material"". "
3,4.0,2.0, HUMNNTR4504,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,CLARA,MILLER,"She gave a super tearjerker graduation speech on the last day of class, so you can tell she really cares about her students. Otherwise, her exam format is 20 multiple choice questions. It sounds straightforward, but because there are only 20 questions, you need to know the material well because there is only so much room for error."
