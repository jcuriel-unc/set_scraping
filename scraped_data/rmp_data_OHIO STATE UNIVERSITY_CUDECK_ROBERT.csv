1,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"His classes are super boring and slow. If I wasn't pretty good at stats going in, I would not have done well. He isn't a very good teacher, but he's a nice guy and very flexible."
2,2.0,3.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,one of the worst teachers I've had- incredibly confusing & boring. Makes it ten times harder than it has to be. 3 exams and weekly homework are the only grades. too many questions on the exam for the time given and asks you to calculate things he gave you in hw examples so you have no idea how to do it. SPSS is hard to get at first but gets better
3,4.5,4.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"For someone who has no interest in stats, I thought he taught it well.  He is very quirky, but it made things interesting.  Homework is very challenging.  8+ hours per assignment, one a week.  Overall, not bad."
4,1.5,5.0, PS826,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,This class is useless for research and Dr. Cudeck is more worried about how to make figures look a certain way than teaching the class about the data that make the figure.  This course hasn't changed in several years and it is clearly missing the mark for what graduate students need.
5,4.5,5.0, PSYCH321H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"One of my favorite professors. Quirky as hell, interesting as hell, hard as hell. SAS is tough, but he's very responsive to email questions. A very nice guy."
6,5.0,5.0, PSYCH826,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,Prof. Cudeck reached an 'impossible' goal: interesting and contextualized stats classes! His solid knowledge and didactics are impressive. With a witty sense of humor he associates funny stories and course contents: that helps us remember this arid subject. SAS is hard but he is most helpful and always extremely polite with everyone. Excellent!
7,5.0,4.0, PSYCHH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"Dr. Cudeck is a brilliant psychologist.The only downside is that is attempting to teach statistics to psychology kids, who can't do math to save their lives.His class is challenging.SAS takes a while to learn, and the homeworks are tedious.Model your assignments after his notes. Most folks are just bitter about their grade, should've tried harder."
8,2.0,1.0, PSYCH826,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,Awful teacher. Easy material but he seems more interested in sharing his life than in teaching you anything. Highly subjective grading even if you get all the answers right (aesthetic is the main criterion) and no explanation is ever provided. Avoid!
9,2.5,2.0, PSYCHH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"Funny/nice guy but class was so boring. Stopped going about halfway through. All he does is hand you a 10 page packet of notes and then read them for two hours. Tests all multiple choice and you are allowed to make a cheat sheet. If you can catch on to SAS and pretty much just copy the codes he uses in lab the hmwk will not take you 8 hours, just 2"
10,4.5,4.0, PSYCHH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,Awesome teacher. The homework takes time and you have to learn how to edit the codes he gives you if you don't want to spend 8+ hours on each assignment. He lets you bring a page or two of your own notes for the midterm and final.  The notes he gives you are amazing- I only needed to look at my book once or twice.
11,2.5,3.0, PSYCHH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,Hard class and long homeworks. Need to be willing to put time into studying for midterm and final. Homework usually averaged 8 hours and required SAS code understanding. Office Hours helpful!
12,2.0,4.0, STAT321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"Very disorganized. Always late to class, never graded things or put out assignments on time. You don't really have any idea what your grade is. The assignments aren't too hard, though, and some of the lectures are more interesting than others. I think this will help me later in life but the class was just so disorganized it was frustrating."
13,2.5,5.0, PSYCHH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,Very intelligent teacher but forgets others have little stats background. Notes are handed out in class but are quite confusing. The book is the best way to go to learn material. SAS is like hell if you don't understand computer code (8 hour hw). Not always helpful in class but if you go to him and  express concern he'll be more than helpful.
14,4.0,4.0, PSYCHH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"Funny guy, but no one can make stats interesting.  SAS is a pain, but all you have to do is copy the codes he gives you, and then modify it to your problem.  He answered all questions in class, and he frequently checks his e-mail."
15,1.0,5.0, PSYCHH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"Do NOT take this class. He's rude, refuses to answer most questions--when he does it's in an unhelpful manner. He does not explain things well either. On the tests the questions ask for things that are different from what he wants, you have to be practically psychic to pass. The grading is unfair and sporadic. Worst class ever."
16,1.0,5.0, PSYCHH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"RIDICULOUS! Unless you love SAS do NOT take this class. The program apparently can't be put on Macs or Vista, so you're basically screwed. He's completely unfair, and rude. This was the worst class I have ever taken!"
17,5.0,3.0, PSYH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"Cudeck is wicked funny.  All these other commentors wouldn't know a joke if it jumped up and bit them.  If you don't like the lecture, go to office hours.  He's great."
18,2.0,3.0, PSYCHH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,He avoided answering questions and was generally disrespectful. He did a terrible job explaining SAS and took off points on the homework for things not even specified on the assignment. The textbook was TERRIBLE and so hard to understand. I got a 95 on the first midterm and a 54 on the second midterm so watch out. The final wasnt bad.
19,2.5,5.0, PSYCHH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"Definitely try to get the other teacher.  If Cudeck is your only option, try the homework first and work with SAS.  Then, take your questions to him at office hours!  He will help you so much and at the end of the quarter, the visit will boost your effort grade!  He is a really friendly guy and likes to tell stories, he's just bad at teaching..."
20,1.5,4.0, PSYCHH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,CUDECK,"Classes are completely unorganized. He can be very unclear in explaining the material, and often dismisses students questions and concerns when raised in class. Grading is rather unfair, as he takes credit off for frivolous reasons and even admits that he is unfair, but does nothing to change it. Easily one of the worse educators I've ever had."
