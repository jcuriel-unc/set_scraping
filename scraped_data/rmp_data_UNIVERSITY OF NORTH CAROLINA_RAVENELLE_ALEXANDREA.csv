1,4.0,3.0, SOCI427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"She tries really hard to be engaging & is funny most of the time (some jokes just don't land). The group project is annoying, but if your group is on top of it a good grade is doable. The TA grades just about everything so as long as you have a good TA it's fine. There are small responses due at the beginning of each class based on the reading."
2,3.0,1.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,She's really passionate about sociology and tries to make lectures fun. Bottom line: the material is not hard and you don't need to attend class at all. Grades are based on weekly quizzes and a few tests and papers; easy to get an A. 
3,5.0,2.0, MNGT427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"Honestly yes sometimes the lectures are a bit dry, but if you have a solid TA, the class will be a breeze. If you do the readings and take notes you'll get extra credit at the end of the semester just for doing them. I recommend her if you can get her, attendance is mandatory but also not at the same time. Midterms and final were pretty easy too. "
4,1.0,1.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE," In one lecture she had twenty students come to the front of the lecture hall and line up by skin color in some backwards way of trying to make a point. She is well-intentioned but tone deaf and just misses the mark. Required attendance (even though lecture is large), made us read her own book even though it wasn't relevant to the course content."
5,5.0,3.0, SOCI427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"Dr. Ravenelle is really funny and her lectures are enjoyable. Although I agree with some of the comments saying that the group project was frustrating, I wouldn't let it stop you from taking the class as you can learn a lot from it! The grading was very fair and the readings were also really interesting."
6,4.0,3.0, SOCI427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"Dr. Ravenelle's class was not too bad. Readings were not dense but you need to do the daily participation assignments. Both the midterm and final were online, essay-based. About a month and a half is centered around a group project that was a frustrating experience. We were trained to use a coding platform that was not very helpful. TA was great!"
7,2.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"She was ok.  Her lectures could be hard to sit through.  She tries to be funny/snarky, and it often doesn't really work out.  Pretty easy class, though.  I wouldn't say I recommend her, but I also didn't absolutely hate her."
8,5.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,She had really entertaing lectures and all of the homework/ tests were very easy. 
9,1.0,5.0, SOCI320,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"On top of her unbearable lectures, Ravenelle had a terrible attitude towards her students and gave poor instructions for assignments. Grades were seemingly determined by her TA flipping a coin and were inconsistent across students and assignments. Rubrics were poor, and she had a group project as the final and the highest grade was an 80 lol. "
10,1.0,3.0, SOCI427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"Tries very hard to be funny but isn't. A lot of the lessons I learned from this class (which mainly came from the readings and videos she made us watch, not necessarily her lectures) I also learned in MNGT 131. What I couldn't stand is she would read emails but not reply. She would condescendingly tell u she read ur email. Very wishy washy."
11,1.0,3.0, SOCI427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"She's a smart lady, but very condescending and not considerate towards students. She gives no rubric or clear instructions on anything and grades very hard. I would avoid this class unless you need it for your major. Super lecture heavy as well, and very boring."
12,2.0,3.0, MNGT427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"Professor Ravenelle's class was not extremely difficult (attendance assignments with readings, essays, essay-based midterm/final, and a big group project). There is not a rubric or grading criteria provided for any of the assignments, and she is a tough-grader. Not too hard of a class, but extremely boring lectures, and not very accommodating."
13,1.0,3.0, SOCI427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"The class overall was fine. Our TA was amazing and she did 90% of the grading. However, none of the professors assignments had guidelines and the one thing she did grade she was super harsh for no good reason. Lectures were extremely boring too. Overall the professor was not great but the class was fine."
14,1.0,3.0, MNGT427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"Would not recommend this class AT ALL unless you have to have it. I did not enjoy it and honestly, the material is all pretty much common knowledge if you've watched the news once since 2010. It's not hard but extremely boring and rather irrelevant. I also did not like the way I felt the professor had extremely vague instructions. Don't take :)"
15,1.0,3.0, SOCI417,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"Do not take the class unless it's for a major. Professor Ravenelle is a nice lady, but not a considerate professor. There was many changes throughout the class which were not updated in the syllabus, like attendance! Lectures are very boring and a waste of time. No lectures are posted online for reference, so good luck on midterms/finals!"
16,4.0,3.0, SOCI427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,"Dr. Ravenelle is a great choice for SOCI427. There is a lot of work including a group project but, it helps your grade in the long run. Midterm and final not super hard, just essays. She is pretty funny and keeps lecture entertaining. Definitely feel like I learned a lot too!"
17,5.0,2.0, SOCI427,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ALEXANDREA,RAVENELLE,Professor Ravenelle made a class about labor force fun and enjoyable. She also loves to play John Oliver clips once in awhile and she always assigns interesting articles related to class content. Highly recommend taking this course with her and also I love her humor!
