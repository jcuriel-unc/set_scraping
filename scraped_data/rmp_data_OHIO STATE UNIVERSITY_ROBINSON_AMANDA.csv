1,5.0,2.0, POLITSC4250,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"Dr. Robinson is a great professor. As long as you do the reading and attend lectures, the class is very easy.  She also curves the exams if many students struggle with certain questions and offers extra credit opportunities. If you do the work, it is very easy to get an A. Also, the lectures are info heavy but still interesting."
2,1.0,4.0, POLITSC4250,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"the exams are terrible. They donot even seem that hard while you are taking them, but she grades like a hound. Average of the first exam was a 68, no curve. She offers little extra credit and the only plus is she drops the lowest 8 quiz grades, but with the exams being worth 70% of ur grade it does not really matter now does it. I would avoid it. "
3,4.0,4.0, PS3596,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,Toughest political science course I have taken at OSU. The course takes a scientific approach to identity and ethnicity which means you are put through a meat grinder of reading material throughout the semester. You will not pass if you are not keeping up with the readings. Everything is fair game on exams. Write everything down!
4,4.0,4.0, PS3596,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"Dr. Robinson is a tough prof, but if you do the readings then you can do well. While there are a lot, they're very instructive on nat'lism and ethnicity. She's a brilliant scholar, and if you are thinking about research then she's a great person to ask for help. Grading is mostly exams plus reading quizzes. You get out of the class what you put in."
5,3.0,5.0, PS3596,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"Dr. Robinson is brilliant, but her class is way harder than it has to be. Super difficult reading quizzes, and lots of stuff on tests that were hardly covered. Interesting class, but I definitely would not take it again."
6,3.0,3.0, POLITSC3596,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"While Amanda clearly knows her material, she is extremely monotone and doesn't get students engaged or involved. The material can seem a little repetitive and it would have gone smoother if the class structure was different."
7,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4250,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"Dr. Robinson taught such an amazing class. I learned so much and the assignments were sort of fun. We had a presentation and paper and I actually sort of enjoyed those. The exams also weren't bad, they were online and open note. There are small reading quizzes everyday, but if you read they are super easy. Loved this class."
8,2.0,5.0, POLITSCI3596,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"Amanda has a lot of potential to be a good professor. But she is awful. Her class is asinine, the study guides are no help on the tests, and she's boring. Dozens of pages of reading each night. I would not take this class if I were forced to. It's way so hard it's not worth it."
9,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4250,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"This is the third class I have taken with Dr. Robinson. Although you have to work for an A, her classes will teach you a ton and she is extremely intelligent and well respected in her field."
10,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4245H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"This was the first time Democratic Erosion was offered at OSU and Prof. Robinson did a great job with it even though it's not her area of expertise. Lots of reading (about 100 pages/wk), but workload is manageable all things considered. Hopefully OSU continues to offer this course and has her teach it at least a couple more times!"
11,5.0,3.0, POLITSC3596,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"Seems to really care about how her teaching is going and how she can improve herself. Reading quizzes for each class, but they are only like two easy questions each."
12,3.5,3.0, PS4250,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"Dr. Robinson is great! She is extremely passionate and knowledgable about the material being covered. She also gave us a one sided sheet of paper as a cheat sheet for the exams. There is  paper and presentation that take some effort, but its certainly not absurd amount of work. The hardest part of the course was the map quiz on Africa"
13,3.5,5.0, PS3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"She is extremely knowledgable and loves what she teaches. Class can get boring at times and she may not be as engaging but she cares about the subject a lot. She is a VERY VERY TOUGH professor in grading exams and constructing them. Be prepared to work hard. I got an A but considering the amount of coursework, the class should have been a 4000. "
14,4.5,3.0, PS3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,Robinson is a great teacher. She really wants her students to do well. She makes sure to ask students if her current teaching style is working and reworks the curriculum to help the students learn better. If you pay attention and stay on main points you'll do fine. A good person overall.
15,5.0,4.0, POLITSC3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,"One of the best courses I have had here at OSU!  Dr. Robinson is an excellent professor and I would take anything that she taught. The lectures were engaging and fun. Not your average poli sci class, she teaches using a variety of disciplines and challenges you to think for yourself. Very helpful in office hours and gives points back on exams.  "
16,5.0,3.0, 457902,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMANDA,ROBINSON,Good instructor. She's loves what she teaches and has experience. Very nice approachable and friendly. Gives pop quizzes over readings to do random attendances checks. Tests and lectures are straightforward
