1,5.0,1.0, 1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"Super funny and clearly loves sociology. His lectures are funny, most content id from textbook.1-2 chapters per week, a lecture video, and a discussion post. You will get all the points if you do the work. There are 2 midterms and 1 optional test and essay at the end of the year, as well as a discussion for extra credit. "
2,5.0,1.0, 1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"Super easy intro level soc class, if you do the reading necessary (there isn't much) the class will be a breeze. The only way you could get a bad grade is if you literally do not put any work in. "
3,3.0,3.0, 1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"I did not vibe well with him. Most of his lectures were way too long, longer then they needed to be, and we watched about 6 movies that were required for the discussion posts. You will mostly be communicating with the TA assigned to your group. Most of his material is at least two years old. I would recommend taking it with another professor. "
4,5.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,I really enjoyed having Dr. Lopez as my professor. He made the lectures interesting and he was very enjoyable to listen to no matter what subject matter we were learning. The workload was very light with a discussion post and quiz every week and two exams total. I highly recommend taking this class. 
5,2.0,1.0, 1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,The other reviews of this professor are incredibly misleading and I regret listening to them. You will spend more time listening to him complain about Fox News and Rush Limbaugh in lectures than you will actually learning about sociology. I highly recommend taking this class with another professor. His recorded lectures are a complete waste of time
6,3.0,3.0, 1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"the weekly discussion boards usually required a lot of reading, watching long lectures, watching documentaries, etc. very time consuming "
7,4.0,1.0, 1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,Steven Lopez is a professor who truly cares about what he's teaching and teaching at large. He was very passionate in his lectures about every chapter we learned and was receptive to student comments. 2 mandatory exams and both were easy. Discussion posts were graded very leniently - just show effort and thinking. Weekly quizzes were easy.
8,5.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"theres a quiz, discussion and lecture assignment due every week, must submit discussion by saturday or 2 points are taken for ""late"" work even though the due date is sunday. make sure to watch lectures for midterms/finals because he often had questions pertaining to what he says in lecture."
9,5.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"I took this class all online and he would post one 1 hr prerecorded lecture, a weekly quiz,and a discussion post per week. As long as you spread the work out throughout the week it was manageable and a good option if you need credit for SOC1101.If I had to be picky, the quizzes being due on Friday and the discussion posts on Saturday was not ideal."
10,5.0,1.0, 1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"I really enjoyed this course. Lectures did get a little boring at times (not the professors fault, just the information itself.) He incorporates stories and examples that help you understand the material better. The quizzes and discussions are pretty easy as long as you listen to lectures. A very easy but beneficial introduction course!"
11,5.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"He was great! His lectures were engaging, we didn't have too much homework each week besides a weekly write-up and an easy post test. Grading criteria was very clear, and he follows a routine that's easy to get used to since it's the same every week. As long as you do the assignments, you'll succeed in his class."
12,5.0,3.0, SOCIO1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,One of my favorite classes and professors this semester by far. You can tell Dr. Lopez is really passionate about the subject. Funny guy and a good lecturer. There are weekly discussion posts and quizzes. Lectures are normally anywhere from 1-2 hours but super interesting if you like the subject. Pay attention to lectures and take good notes.
13,5.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"Best professor Ive had at OSU so far. Lectures and content are entertaining, its an easy A and I only spent a couple of hours per week on coursework."
14,1.0,4.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"this course is totally a nightmare for non-native speakers, and he usually speak rudely in class"
15,4.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"He's a really good teacher and lecturer, but he does go on tangents and he's slightly insufferable to sit through. He lets his opinions be known and thinks he's right about everything. He also cusses a lot, which just isn't needed. But he is very passionate and for an intro GE, the class is pretty easy and mildly interesting."
16,5.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"Great dude, and a great lecturer. Took this class online asynchronously and still felt connected with him. Definitely not afraid to be opinionated but keeps class pretty light. Lectures were decently long (1-2 hours/week) plus documentaries were often assigned and you had to read a 30 pg-ish long chapter/week, but it was skimmable. 10/10 prof"
17,5.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"Really interesting and funny guy. He's knowledgeable. Quizzes, tests, and discussion posts are all pretty easy, at least for the online version of this class."
18,5.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,Steve is absolutely incredible at everything. So much passion. I want to take every single class with him. His class also isn't super difficult as long as you do the approx. hour-2hour notes and lectures each week. (class taken asynchronously).
19,4.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,"Class was pretty easy, weekly quizzes on the chapter, use quizlet or read the chapter to study and youll pass. Discussion posts sometimes have a lot to watch/read but you could probably pass those too by skimming. Exams were like quizzes + Qs on what he said in lecture so at least watch those. Otherwise not hard and pretty interesting!"
20,5.0,3.0, SOCIO1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,STEVEN,LOPEZ,Professor Steve was a great professor! His lectures are long but most certainly entertaining to watch. Hes a great guy with a good personality. Homework's are not hard just do the readings and ATTEND LECTURES OR WATCH THE LECTURES HE HAS UP. The tests aren't hard just make sure you listen closely to his lectures. Pay attention and youre fine!!!!!!
