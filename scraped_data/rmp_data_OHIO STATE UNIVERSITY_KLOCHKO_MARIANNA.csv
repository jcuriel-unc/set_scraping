1,2.0,4.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,I survived this class bc of the textbook. Her lectures are very confusing and she is a very tough grader/ no room to make ANY mistakes. Doesn't give good feedback.
2,3.0,4.0, SOC4451,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"Took this class during Covid-19 times and you REALLY have to work hard for a good grade. There are at least 2 short papers each week, which she expects you to discuss during Zoom meetings. She doesn't give rubrics, just gives examples of previous student papers. You can only miss like 2 classes without tanking your participation grade."
3,4.0,3.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"She is a pretty laid back prof. Everything you need for the exams are in the notes you should be taking. She does give home, but it is pretty easy. She is a tough grader when it comes to it, but it's just common sense. She can be stern when she needs to, but if you follow her rules, which are pretty insignificant, you'll do great."
4,4.0,4.0, SOC410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,She's very fair. I got away with calling Karl Marx and idiot and still got an A or A-. Don't be a child and you will be fine.
5,2.0,4.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"Professor klochko is cool and all but her accent makes it hard to understand during lecture, considering she talks very fast. Class is mostly lecture"
6,1.0,4.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"Definitely not ""the greatest thing since slice bread"", if you know what I mean. If you miss one day in that class, you are setting yourself up for failure, especially when she doesn't do any make-up assignments. Her grading style is difficult to understand and unfair. Good luck if you take this class, you're going to need it."
7,2.0,4.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"She's not personal, almost to a harsh point. The class as a whole was interesting but the way she goes about teaching it is awful, the textbook is clearer than she ever was."
8,2.0,4.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"Klochko is an unpopular Sociology professor at OSU Marion. She has a cold personality. I received As & Bs on almost every test and paper, but missed a few classes because I was sick. She was puzzled on why I was doing well in her class, but somehow I ended up with a C as a final grade. I have received As in all my other Soc classes."
9,3.5,4.0, 359701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"Dr. Klochko is knowledgeable and willing to help students. Though with that being said, she can come off as intimidating. Her expectations for the papers and presentation were not clear and the atmosphere of the classroom was uncomfortable. Don't take this course unless you love to participate and read."
10,2.0,5.0, GLOBALPROBLEMS,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,Expectations are very UNclear! Very negative attitude and always harsh.
11,4.5,4.0, SOC310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"Dr. Klochko is a great professor, but definitely not a professor you want to take unless you are willing to put forth your best effort. She is extremely demanding, and expects 110% from her students. I learned a great deal from her class, and in the end, though I recived the lowest grade of my college career, I know I got the grade I earned."
12,4.5,3.0, SOC210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"Dr. Klochko is a straight-up professor. She doesn't cut any slack and she demands hard work. She expects class participation and grades each student on his or her involvement with the subjects being discussed. If you read the assigned coursework (not really optional), do your homework, and participate in class discussions, then you should do well."
13,4.5,2.0, SOC410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"Marianna Klochko is straight up - listen, study and participate and you will do very well. Ignore this and you might as well go home. I have noticed that the complainers don't participate in class and are generally poorly prepared to be a student at OSU. Eventhough Marianna offers help and advice the complainers ignore her open and frequent offers."
14,2.5,5.0, CRIM110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,EVIL is not a harsh enough word. You don't feel like your in class but more like in some sort of a military academy. And her Ukranian accent makes it hard to understand her.
15,1.0,5.0, SOC410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"she is a very mean teacher, be careful if you have feelings, she is evil"
16,5.0,4.0, SOC410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"Marianna is a wonderful professor. You can count on her to follow through on everything that she says. She is honest and hard working, and expects the same from you. I learned so much from her, and hope to have her again!"
17,5.0,3.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"Great instructor. Knows her stuff, is direct & to the point. Material & her lectures are the same way.  Really enjoyed this class.  I highly recommen her."
18,5.0,3.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,Excellent teacher - would take more courses under her.
19,5.0,3.0, ANYSOCCLASS,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,"This professor is very strict but a grrreat instructor! She definitely knows her stuff and teaches as such. Her exams are tough but if you study and use the guide she hands out, you should do fine. DO NOT talk in class while she is speaking...she will not tolerate! She gives extra credit & encourages office visits. I just love her...cute accent!"
20,4.0,1.0, 100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARIANNA,KLOCHKO,She's a nice woman.  Her class comes directly from the book.  I mean DIRECTLY!  Easy exams.  Just make sure you follow exactally what she wants for papers.  She gets really mad when the papers aren't just as she asks them to be.
