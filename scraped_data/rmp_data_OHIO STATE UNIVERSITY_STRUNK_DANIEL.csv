1,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"He is really passionate about what he teaches. Tbh sometimes it's hard to stay awake in his class if you have it for 80 minutes since it's all lecturing. He doesn't take attendance, but you'd be a fool not to go because he tells you the test essay question options in class and gives extra info than what's on the slides alone. He curves most tests."
2,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"Grade solely based on four (rather hard) exams. Twenty-five multiple choice (3pts each) and one 25pt extended response on all four exams. No cumulative final. Material was very interesting, professor tells cool stories about his job as a clinician, but these rants often completely unconnected to exam material. Class not required, slides posted."
3,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,Great person but terrible teacher. He goes off on tangents that are impossible to follow and expects you to know that information for the test. Tests are only 25 mc with one or two short answers and are so easy to do bad on. If you miss a lecture be sure to get the notes from someone or else you won't pass the class.
4,5.0,4.0, 3331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,Excellent professor. Exams are straightforward and willing to provide a lot good feedback for the potentially daunting 10-page paper.
5,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,No surprises on the midterms. The final was not cumulative. Had to write one research paper- START AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. Got really good feedback on the paper from Dr. Strunk before turning it in which was very helpful. Show up to class and study the notes given in class. Reading the textbook helped me but I could still have done as will without it
6,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"I realyl liked the class because I found the material very interesting but Dr. Strunk made it more difficult to get an A because the only grades were the 4 exams (no extra credit). You can tell he likes teaching, and he is good at explaining everything, but he does like to rant, and it's important to take notes on EVERYTHING because it is tested on"
7,5.0,2.0, 3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,You will only get out of the class what you put into it but the professor is very knowledgeable and ready to answer every question. Also very good-looking.
8,4.5,2.0, 3331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"If you come to class and study your notes you'll do fine. His tests are extremely fair, and your grade will be reflective of the amount of studying you did. Not a difficult class if you put in the effort."
9,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,Literally THE WORST class i have taken at OSU! I am in my forth year so ive taken enough classes to say that and mean it! Unclear in lectures and teaches beyond a comprehensible level.   Exams based on notes but notes are basically anything he says on his RANDOM TANGENTS! AVOID THIS PROFESSOR!
10,2.5,4.0, PSYCH3331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"Dr. Strunk is amazing in his field, but he expects you to share in his passion. It took me a while to realize this, but the tests are largely based off of class notes, but you can't get them unless you show up to every class.  I struggled, but I was always below the average, so it might have just been me."
11,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"Strunk is a depression researcher and focuses only on his research during his class.  This class is supposed to talk about abnormal psych, something I am very interested in, and he made it so boring and narrowly focused that I really wish I had taken it with someone else."
12,1.0,4.0, PSYCH3331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"He says he's there to help, but half asses his ""help"" and simply refers you to an article or the textbook rather than explain. Slow at returning graded materials and is overall not a good professor. Extremely biased and if your answer is even slightly off or not complete, you'll get a lot of points docked. Avoid this professor."
13,4.0,3.0, PSYCH331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"He is a good professor. His exams are not too difficult and he does curve them to an extent. He is passionate about what he is teaching and wants his students to do well. Also, don't get too scared of the 8-10 page paper he has you write. It's not that bad. The lectures are somewhat interesting, but can make you sleepy at times. Overall, decent!"
14,2.0,4.0, PSYCH331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,Wish I had not taken this class so much. Strunk does not keep up with grading assignments and is incredibly vague. Class was highly boring! This class ruined my 4.0 goal for the quarter!
15,4.0,4.0, PSYCH331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"Strunk did not keep up with any of our work yet he expected a lot out of his students. On the day of the exam, he had only graded 3 out of 13 assignments of that quarter so we had no idea what our grades are. However, the class was boring but attendance was crucial. A lot of outside reading. Class could have been A LOT more interesting/enjoyable"
16,3.5,3.0, PSYCH331H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,Somehow made a very interesting subject boring. Disappointed in this class and wish I hadn't taken it. Did not learn much besides what is covered in an intro psych course.
17,4.5,2.0, PSYCH331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"331 is not that hard.  A lot of people are complaining, but I don't know why.  I never read the book; I just went to class and studied the notes and got A's on both midterms and final.  He curves A LOT, and is very generous w/ grading in my opinion. He is really helpful- offers several review sessions.  Take his class; it's not that bad"
18,3.0,4.0, PSYCH331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"I was very interested in abnormal psych BEFORE this class. He is extremely biased and is not helpful in explaining the material needed for the exams. Final exam was comprehensive, which, with so much info in the class was nearly impossible. The T.A. never came to class just graded our essays as hard as she possibly could. He ruined it for me."
19,4.5,2.0, PSYCH331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"The class was awesome. It got a little long winded being a 1:48 lecture 2x a week, but he let us take breaks to keep us from getting too restless. He makes the content clear and answers all questions pretty quickly."
20,2.0,4.0, PSYC331,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,STRUNK,"The class was very interesting, but was taught in a biased way. It was obvious wich methods and subjects he ageed with or liked the best. Tended to focus on info that wasn't on the test. The TA was useless and didn't attend the lectures but graded the tests which were mostly essay on subject matter covered in class and not in the text."
