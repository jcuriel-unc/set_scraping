1,4.5,3.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,FISHER,She is an alright professor. Studying is an absolute in her class. Material is easy. Most tests are all multiple choice.
2,4.5,4.0, PSYCH551,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,FISHER,I have taken a few classes with Fisher. She's a very good teacher and has lots of ways to make lecture not so boring. Her tests are tough though. You really need to study and understand what's going on. Her classes are interesting but can be tough. It's really not a slack-off kind of class.

4,1.0,5.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,FISHER,"I hated her class.  Very boring, and she failed me by .5 points and would not do anything about.  She makes people do expeirments that dont count for anything.  This class was just plain stupid to take."
