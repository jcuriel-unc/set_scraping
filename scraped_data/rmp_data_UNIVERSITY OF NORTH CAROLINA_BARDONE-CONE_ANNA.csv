1,5.0,4.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,Wowww such a great professor. Anna defenitely cares about her students and is interactive with everyone. I did not do that well in this class but I still recommend it 100%. I learned a lot and the information was very intriguing. The only thing is the exams are hard and there is not a lot of busy work so it is hard to bounce back from a low grade. 
2,5.0,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,"AMAZING! Dr. Bardone-Cone is so passionate about what she teaches which makes her lectures super interesting and engaging. She is also very nice and even baked cookies for everyone on LDOC :') This specific course was pretty easy with participation grades, a couple exams, and a 5-page course paper. I would highly recommend taking PSYC 245 with her!"
3,5.0,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,"Loved this class! All the assignments (except for exams and one paper) were basically completion grades - if you put in effort you made a 100%. All the assignments were easy and even the paper was only 5 pages. We had open book/out of class exams which made them doable but there is a lot of information, so closed book exams might be harder."
4,5.0,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,"Professor Bardone-Cone was the best, she is so nice and knowledgeable about everything. This class was very interesting and easy definitely take if you can"
5,5.0,2.0, IDST190,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,"Professor Bardone-Cone made cookies for my entire lecture hall, a class of 200+ people. IDST 190 is a really easy and interesting class. Essentially if you show up to class and do the readings, you'll do fine in the class and learn a lot in it. 10/10 recommend Professor Bardone-Cone and IDST190"
6,4.0,3.0, IDST190,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,"I enjoyed the Psychology section of this class. ABC was great and I met with her once outside of class and now she sends me articles relating to her research of eating disorders. It's important to know that TAs are the graders in this class, not the professors. I thought it was pretty standard with its courseload and I learned a good bit from her"
7,2.0,4.0, IDST190,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,"Don't take this class. 2 Reading quizzes a week with only 10 min per quiz and so much reading it was impossible to find the answers in the time. Classes were divided between Law, Art History, and Psych. The only reason I gave this a 2 is because Psych was the best one. Have to write 6 Reading Journals, 3 Essays, and there is a Midterm and a Final."
8,3.0,3.0, PSYC89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,This was a good class and she did a good job engaging the class with the material which was generally interesting which made it better. The only real negative was that grades had no description or rubric as to why points were deducted. Overall great teacher and solid FYS. I would encourage it if you're willing to show up.
9,5.0,4.0, PSYC89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,"Anna is intelligent, energetic, and SO caring. Every class, her love for her work inspired me even more. She gives excellent feedback and is extremely helpful in every way. She really values students that speak up and share their thoughts in class! You will learn SO much from Anna. Her lectures are amazing, she is high-energy, funny, and inspiring"
10,4.5,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,She is awesome! Made the 8am class worth going to-very engaging. Loved the class and it was straightforward.
11,4.5,2.0, PSYC66,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,"This class is very interesting and easy to get an A! There are a few group projects that will take up some time. There is quite a bit of reading involved, but because I was interested in the material it was bearable. She is always there to help and is SO understanding. I liked this class so much that I decided to take another with her (PSYC 245)!"
12,5.0,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANNA,BARDONE-CONE,She is a great teacher with high enthusiasm in the subject material. She posts lecture outlines and then neatly follows them in class. The subject isn't very difficult but the test can be tricky if you don't study the terms. Otherwise no homework and one paper.
