1,3.0,3.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"I didn't appreciate how the professor would often ignore comments he didn't agree with, which hindered productive discussion. Furthermore, he often played the devil's advocate and came across as bigoted and ignorant when it came to systemic issues. While he was alright, he wasn't really my cup of tea."
2,5.0,3.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Professor Steiner was wonderful, and this class was great. I went in knowing little to nothing about European politics and came out with an abundance of knowledge. He has a discussion-based format, so come to class prepared (he does occasionally cold-call). Overall, if you are interested in European politics, definitely take this class."
3,5.0,2.0, POLI255H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Professor Steiner is awesome, even with a 2.5 hour long class, it doesn't get boring and the discussion based format is excellent. He always challenged us to think about every perspective and consider different sides of a situation, I learned a lot in this class. He is a fair grader and the group paper is annoying to coordinate but very doable."
4,5.0,3.0, POLI255H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Prof Steiner respects students and encourages critical thinking!! He does ask for participation and perhaps a deeper level of thinking than students are prepared for, but I felt that he does a good job of balancing high expectations with a work-load that is not overwhelming. "
5,5.0,3.0, POLI255H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Great professor. Very engaged and excited about the material. A lot of reading, but great course overall. You learn a lot"
6,5.0,4.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Incredible professor! Be prepared to spend time on the readings - class is discussion-based and lectures are few and far between, so understanding the readings is crucial to earning participation credit. 3 papers and 1 group presentation/paper instead of exams. Tough grader but fair and grades anonymously - feedback made me a much better writer."
7,4.0,4.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Professor Steiner is a very caring and engaging professor! The class is quite difficult and requires a lot of reading. There are several pop quizzes, but they don't count for most of the grade. He cares about how his students feel and is a fair grader. "
8,1.0,4.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,The class wasn't bad per se. It just was a lot of reading and the lectures were drawn out and long.
9,5.0,3.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Professor Steiner is the best! He's knowledgeable, interesting, and engaging. Classes are largely discussion-based. There is a decent amount of reading, but it's all worth it. Grades consist of a midterm paper, a group paper, and a final paper along with discussion posts and weekly reading quizzes. Not too hard of a grader. Take his class!"
10,5.0,3.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Professor Steiner is a great teacher! He cares about his students and actively tries to include them in class discussions. He does require you to read multiple times a week and participation is mandatory in class. He is a slightly tough grader, but overall it was a great class. Highly recommend!"
11,5.0,4.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,Steiner is such a great teacher! I really enjoyed his class you just have to make sure you read the materials that are assigned outside of class. There are 3 essays and 1 group essay and he grades those pretty tough but its a great class to be in. 
12,5.0,3.0, POLI255,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,Incredible professor. Really cares about his students and is engaging. Take his class!
13,5.0,3.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Best prof by far so far at UNC. Truly cares about the students and the subject and wants students to learn/excel. Grading was tough but fair and his feedback on each paper made me a much better writer. If you put in the effort, you will take a lot from this course, if you just want easy credit, there are way better options."
14,5.0,3.0, POLI447,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Steiner is really excellent. He makes an already engaging class even better. Great feedback, understanding, easygoing, smart, etc etc. POLI can easily be boring but he picks great readings to discuss in the next class so it was much more engaging than my other POLI classes. Take a class with Steiner if you can!"
15,5.0,3.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"this class was very discussion heavy and there are few grades, with the majority of grades relying on papers (in which steiner can be a harsh grader). there are many readings, all of which require a forum post. this class is very writing-heavy but incredibly informative."
16,5.0,4.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,Best professor I've had thus far. I learned so much from this class. A good amount of reading but all the articles are interesting and are discussed thoroughly in class. Papers are graded tough but it helps you become a better writer. Definitely not easy but it is so worth it. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!
17,5.0,2.0, POLI255H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,Really fun class as long as you do the readings & engage in discussions. Prof Steiner is accommodating & fosters a great classroom atmosphere.
18,5.0,3.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Professor Steiner is the best teacher I have had yet. He truly cares about all of his students and wants everyone to feel comfortable to participate in group discussions. Each class began with an icebreaker then went into discussion that was based on a reading from the previous night. Essay grading is hard, but fair. Take his class if you can!!"
19,5.0,2.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Hands-down my favorite professor at UNC! I have never been compelled to write a review before, but I appreciate his class so much that I am. He goes out of his way to make sure everyone understands the material and he doesn't lecture, instead we discuss the (short) readings in class and he tries really hard to build a community in the online class."
20,5.0,3.0, POLI255,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NIKLAUS,STEINER,"Dr. Steiner was one of my favorite professors at UNC. He's an incredibly interesting individual, and he loves talking to students one-on-one. Put in the work and you will do well in his classes."
