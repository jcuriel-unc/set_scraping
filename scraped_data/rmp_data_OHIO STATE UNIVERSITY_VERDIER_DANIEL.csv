1,1.0,5.0, PLSCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Avoid by all means. You will be blindsided and no communication whatsoever. If you enjoy playing a memory game and then getting a low mark because you don't say the same words as a 57 year old french nationalist, I would not recommend if you enjoy a high gpa. "
2,1.0,5.0, POLISCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,Class average was a D on both midterm and final. The guy was laughing as he was handing back our midterms. He genuinely takes pleasure in screwing over his students by testing them on definitions that aren't even on his slides! He expects us to memorize 70 definition questions and 21 extended response questions for the final WORD FOR WORD.
3,1.0,5.0, POLISCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"If you write your exam answers in your own words and do not write verbatim what he has on his slides, you WILL receive a low grade for each question. Your answer could mean the exact same thing as what he has on his slides, but you will NOT receive credit. Some questions aren't even on his slides, so how can we write verbatim for those? Terrible."
4,5.0,4.0, PLSCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Really good professor. His teaching style goes a little off the average OSU professor, which is why it upsets people. Lectures are enjoyable, and the material is heavy just like his grading for exams, but it is not that deep. Genuinely a funny and enjoyable professor and his accent has nothing to do with it. Recommend the class a 100% "
5,3.0,4.0, PLSCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Hes alright but his grading is ridiculous (have to memorize definitions word for word). Don't listen to the last 3 posts. They're entertained by an accent, got a decent grade and want to gloat. 

Also, ""butt hurt to hear the reality of the US and its role in international econ""?

Maybe the corniest post I've ever seen on RMP.  Are you 14 or naive?"
6,5.0,3.0, PLSCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Verdier is a great professor, i highly recommend. The class is lecture heavy but not hard. He gives you all the potential questions for the midterm and final. All the people who gave bad review either didnt follow his advice for studying, didn't put in the effort, or are butt hurt to hear the reality of the US and its role in international econ. "
7,5.0,3.0, POLISCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"THESE REVIEWS DO NOT DO HIM JUSTICE. Class is really not that bad. If you ask him he will tell you exactly what he is looking for on the exams, as long as you memorize that its an easy A. He is probably the funniest professor I have ever had. French Mr. Rogers. I always look forward to going to lecture as they never fail to brighten my day."
8,5.0,3.0, POLISCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Verdier is hilarious, I love his class. People who say he is difficult at grading are over-exaggerating. He gives a study guide before tests, and though his definitions are sometimes ambiguous, he gives leeway in grading in the same way. If you study, you'll be fine, I got 100 on the midterm, + there's a curve at the end of the class, dont worry."
9,1.0,5.0, POLISCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Professor Verdier does not understand that not every undergrad has a Doctorate. His tests are extremely difficult and he grades extremely harshly. If you can avoid this class, it might be better for your mental health. "
10,4.0,5.0, POLS4381,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Professor Verdier is a joy in class. He is one of the foremost experts on political finance systems and often his classes and what he teaches will be insanely difficult. Class participation is key, if you ask questions and study his powerpoint you should do well in class. As long as you reach out to him, you'll be okay."
11,1.0,4.0, POLITSCS3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Spare yourself from this professor at all costs. I only managed to finish with an A because half the class was failing. Not only is he vague and confusing in what he expects for assignments and tests, but he literally REFUSES to elaborate when we ask questions, and makes us feel stupid for not reading his mind. Also frequently contradicts himself."
12,1.0,5.0, POLISCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,Terrible. One of the worse experiences of my life. His grading is not clear at all. I have never been so confused by a professor in my life. His tests are just stupid. They're based off of definitions or topics that he never went over or aren't in the textbook. I was so excited to take this class and was thoroughly disappointed.
13,1.0,5.0, POLISCI4553,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"I wouldn't wish this man on my worst enemy. He was the worst professor I have ever had. He is not transparent with grades and thinks all of us have doctorates in this topic like he does. If you have to take it, my only advice is to make a study group. That is the only way you'll make it through. It's a miracle I got a B."
14,2.0,4.0, POLISCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Exams are hand written using lots of definitions. He wants all the definitions are stated in the class but many aren't defined or explained in class. The questions are given ahead of time, but the answers change each time you ask him. The answer to the questions are a moving target."
15,1.0,5.0, POLITSCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Terrible Professor. If u want to be quizzed on the definitions of things that are not defined within the course material sign up. If u want to be thoroughly confused, sign up. If you want to here an elderly man prattle on about economics incoherently, sign up. Im all for your freedom to choose, if your a masochist go for it."
16,1.0,5.0, PS3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Half of the class failed the midterm, avoid at all cost."
17,1.0,4.0, POLYSCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Little experience outside academia. Very strong accent, shows up late to his own class. Power points are confusing so are grading expectations."
18,1.0,4.0, POLISCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Just another example of a career academic shoving globalist propaganda down the throats of their students. One comment on this professor is particularly striking that he is thought regressive. I second this, room for debate not accepted instead continual liberal talking points substantiated by poor data selection."
19,1.0,4.0, PLSCI3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,"Probably one of the most disorganized professors at OSU. Confusing lectures that make no sense, lack of structure, lack of clear grading criteria. Avoid if you can. Classes are taught on broad basing generalizations such as ""trade has no long term effects on employment"" lack of sources and credibility. Professor confuses himself and us."
20,1.0,5.0, PS4381,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIEL,VERDIER,Took Poli sci 4381 with him spring of 2021 and my god that was the most difficult thing I have ever done in my entire life. I would have rather graduated late than take this class if I had known what was to come. Constantly contradicts himself during lecture sometimes I feel like he doesn't even know what he's teaching himself. just don't do it...
