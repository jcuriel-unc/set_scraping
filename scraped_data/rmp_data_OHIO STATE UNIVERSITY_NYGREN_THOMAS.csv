1,5.0,2.0, PSYCH321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"Come to class and read the book and you will be good. His extra credit on the final was ""Tell me a joke that has to do with statistics."" Super helpful on homework and very approachable."
2,2.5,4.0, PSYCH321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,The tests for this class are really random and the questions are more on why you choose something instead of testing if you know how to compute the actual statistics. He is a nice and definitely has a passion for teaching the material. Lab TA was foreign and had many barriers to communicating which made it tough.
3,4.0,4.0, PSY321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"I'm split, the exams got progressively harder, he's not a bad prof. online notes are pretty clear and so is he, I just wish his exams weren't so hard, i don't feel that I learned the mixed/multiANOVA's very well, the ""labs"" kinda help you use SPSS but they aren't structured well, HW takes about 20 min max with SPSS, 7/10"
4,4.5,3.0, PSYCHH220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"A boring subject, but Nygren's genuine interest kept it bearable.  He's extremely nice and very helpful, and posts a lot of helpful stuff on Carmen.  Not a difficult grader.  If you find him unclear, reading the book helps tremendously.  I recommend him."
5,2.0,2.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"Not very helpful on an one on one type situation. SAID you would NEED the book but you don't at all. Way of grading is weird. overall average, if you're competent enough to ACE the tests and figure some things out for yourself."
6,3.5,3.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"I recommend this teacher, and I'm a tough critic. He made the subject of judgment and decision making interesting and also its  useful for life, I actually learned a few things, he made math simple and fun, who does that?! Its not that hard, take your stats before it though."
7,2.0,1.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"This guy is a complete ****, I got A's on both tests and an A- on the final presentation. He didn't like me so he docked my partcipation points so that my grade ended up being a 92.9%, and he refused to give me an A. My friend didn't say a word the whole quarter, and got full participation points. He's dull a hell, and class was excruciating"
8,5.0,1.0, PSYCHH321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"Excellant teacher... posts the answers to homework assignments before they're due, but just working through the problems and going to class will prepare you for exams. Very helpful, and actually makes the subject interesting while it could be very boring. He's also rediculously intelligent, which you realize the second you start talking to him."
9,5.0,1.0, PSYCHH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,I've taken three honors classes with him and am sad that I can't take three more. He is hands down my favorite Psychology professor and he's also one of the nicest people on campus!
10,4.0,1.0, PSYCHH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"Nice guy.  I took H321 and H508 with him, and both classes were pretty easy.  Tests were mostly subjective, and the averages were really high.  He wants everyone to do well, and it's not hard to get an A in his classes."
11,5.0,1.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"Easy class and very nice guy.  I think the average on our first midterm must have been around 90%, even though it is all essays.  Meeting basic requirements will get you an A."
12,4.5,2.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"A real sweetheart! Always willing to listen and help. Get in good with him and he would LOVE to write a letter of recommendation for you. All essay exams, but grades fair. Would definetely recommend him!"
13,3.5,1.0, PSYCHH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"It's stats, and therefore it's boring. He tried to make it interesting though. More often than not, not many people followed anything he was doing in class, but the tests weren't bad at all. It's the kind of class I've come to expect from the Psychology department."
14,4.5,2.0, PSYCHH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"so nice, will always go out of his way to help students.  class was not too hard, and he even though it was stats, he sometimes made it interesting"
15,5.0,1.0, PSYCH508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,Dr. Nygren was the best professor I ever had! So nice and interested in teaching. Halped change my grade from an A- to an A so that I was able to graduate on time. I would take all of his classes if I could go back!
16,5.0,2.0, H321AND508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"he even made the tests fun because of extra credit questions like, ""guess what song he listens to while jogging and why"""
17,4.0,4.0, PSYCH827,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"Tom is a very nice guy and somehow manages to be interested in ANOVA. However, the tests are very difficult, particularly the take-home portion of the final. Be prepared to spend at least 5 hours on it.  That said, the content of the course is very useful for your actual research.  The bottom line: since you don't have a choice of professors, just be prepared for the course to take up a lot of your time and plan your winter schedule accordingly."
18,3.0,3.0, PSYCH321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"He's very nice and really willing to help with anything.  He doesn't realize when he is being unclear, but if you call him on it, he's more than willing to explain again.  Tests aren't too bad."
19,4.5,2.0, PSYCHH320,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,THOMAS,NYGREN,"Very kind and fair professor.  Sometimes unclear in class lectures, but always willing to expain things further.  The TA grades homeworks and exams, but Nygren is lenient - if you are even partially right, he'll give you all the points back, so don't be afraid to go in and argue points!"
