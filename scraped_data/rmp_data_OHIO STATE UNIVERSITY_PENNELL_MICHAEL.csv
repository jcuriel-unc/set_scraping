1,5.0,3.0, PUBHBIO8235,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,PENNELL,"Dr Pennell is a nice professor. His teaching is clear and notes are organized. He is open to his class and open to many questions. Even if you haven't registered the class for some reason but still want to go to the class for some topics, he is still OK with that. A really responsible instructor."
2,1.0,2.0, STAT7755,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MICHAEL,PENNELL,"Be alert if you are going to work with him. He is not reasonable to talk and does not trust students for what they said. He is not nice and supportive when it comes to any help. He also complains and say something unfair about his student in the presence of other professors. So, Good luck!"
