1,5.0,2.0, SOC3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,"Dr. Schoon was an amazing lecturer! There was a situation I had where I had submitted something late, but after explaining my situation, she allowed me to get full credit for it. 2 of the discussion posts and readings are dropped, and there are plenty of opportunities for extra credit. Make sure you don't wait until last minute to do the work!"
2,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,"Dr. Schoon is such a genuine human and professor! Her class is easy and straightforward, consisting of discussion boards and article summaries. I had an issue with COAM for another class as she and my other class had the same prompt of writing my personal immigration history. She was so understanding and even wrote a letter advocating for me. "
3,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,"Dr. Schoon is very passionate and informed about the work she does. Her lectures were interesting but not mandatory you can still get an A without them. The textbook was only for the quizzes and it is free online and there are weekly reading discussions and extra credit opportunities throughout the semester. Would def take her again,"
4,5.0,2.0, SOC3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,Though this class did have a weekly reading and discussion post due it truly is not that bad. There is a ton of extra credit available and three discussions and a reading summary get dropped. This is an easy A class just don't wait till the last second to do the work. 
5,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,I really enjoyed taking this class with professor Schoon. The workload was manageable and the course was super interesting.
6,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,Dr. Schoon is one of my favorite professors at OSU! Definitely take a class with her if you get the chance. 
7,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,"Professor Schoon was an amazing professor for Sociology 3302! This class was offered online over the summer and was seriously the easiest A I have ever received (plus, it's a 3 credit hour course). It is an easy GPA booster if you need an easy class! I recommend taking it online"
8,1.0,1.0, SOC3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,What a waste of my time. Easy A though.
9,1.0,4.0, SOCIOL3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,"This is a very writing and reading heavy course. There are required readings weekly and each reading is around 15-25 pages long. Plus textbook reading and smaller readings. If I would have known this was a reading and writing course, I wouldn't have taken the class."
10,4.0,4.0, SOC3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,"Dr. Schoon was a really engaging professor and had a very well organized course. However, she is very inflexible when it comes to formatting and submitting assignments. The content of her course is not very difficult however she makes things more complicated than they should be."
11,5.0,2.0, POLS4940,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,Dr. Schoon is extremely caring and exceedingly smart. Her class is engaging and expects engagement from students as well. Grading was fair and extra credit was abundant.
12,4.0,1.0, POLISCI4940,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,"Dr. Schoon is inexperienced as a political science teacher, but I'm confident she will continue improving. The class was structured in a way that makes getting an A easy, Dr. Schoon is funny and willing to take feedback.. She gives opportunities for extra credit and she works hard to make sure the class discusses many points that may not be popular"
13,3.0,4.0, POLITSC4940,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,DANIELLE,SCHOON,Make sure you do the readings otherwise you wont pass (LOTS of reading). Her midterm and final are both part multiple choice/fill in and part essay turned in on Carmen. Class is very liberal and one-sided on topics. Lots of opportunities for extra credit. I wouldnt recommend unless youre very passionate about immigration topics.
