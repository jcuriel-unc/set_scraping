It's an easy and interesting class with no tests, only short weekly writing assignments, and a group project. You get to learn from a really caring and intelligent professor who makes the class fun. He is very helpful and understanding with deadlines or missing class. He's the best professor I've had so far."
2,5.0,1.0, PSYC89H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,"If you are a freshman, TAKE THIS CLASS. It is not overwhelming at all. No final exam or final paper, so you have more time to study for finals for other classes. You have very short (around 200 words) writing assignments each week, and one presentation you do in a group in class. It was so easy, and let me get close to a great professor."
3,5.0,3.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,TAKE THIS CLASS: super interesting and great lectures. Some topics were more interesting than others but Abramowitz always made them enjoyable. He is a really cool guy and great teacher. The grade is based on 3 exams and 2 papers. The exams are fair if you take good notes. You can't miss any class though because he doesn't post the full slideshows.
4,5.0,1.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,Abramowitz is the best! So knowledgable about psychopathology. Lecture heavy but there's interesting videos and he's a great lecturer. Tests are 75% of your grade but all multiple choice and very straight forward. Easy A and great prof!
5,5.0,1.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,"If you need an easy A and don't mind attending lecture every class, TAKE ABNORMAL WITH ABRAMOWITZ. Seriously. Just do it."
6,4.0,1.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,"The best prof I've had so far. His class is 75% exams and 25% final essay, I was hesitant about that but the tests are extremely easy if you go to class and listen. He doesn't post full lectures so attendance is a must. Super nice guy and I really enjoyed his class even though I hate psych."
7,5.0,3.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,"Super chill professor. Nice, friendly, easily accessible. Willing to give feedback. Good lectures. Expects participation (part of your grade). Interesting lectures. Would definitely take this professor again."
8,5.0,1.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,"Dr. Abramowitz is awesome!! He is so passionate about psychology and really wants everyone to do well. As long as you go to class and take notes, you will do fine on the exams. There are just 3 non-cumulative exams and a paper on a movie about a psychological disorder. He is a great lecturer and very kind!!"
9,5.0,3.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,Very engaging and clearly cares about the success of his students! As long as you come to class and take good lecture notes you will be fine. Each test is 25% and 10 page final paper is also 25%
10,5.0,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,"Professor Abramowitz is a super fun and interesting lecturer. I love that he helps illustrate concepts using stories from his own experience as a clinical psychologist. The class is very easy - the tests only have questions from the lectures, so reading the textbook is completely unneccesary. Besides the three tests, there is just one final paper."
11,5.0,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,"Seriously the best prof I've ever taken at UNC. He's very passionate about the material and his tests reflect the lectures well. The only ""complaint"" I have is that he doesn't post his full ppts online, so you have to go to class to get all the info. 75% of the grade is tests & 25% final essay, so take that for what you will. 10/10 would take again"
12,4.0,1.0, PSYC89H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,"Professor Abramowitz clearly loves what he does, and is extremely intelligent.  He enjoys discussion, and encourages it in his class.  Professor Abramowitz specializes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and it was extremely interesting to see the way he tied in his daily work to his class."
13,5.0,2.0, PSYC245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,"One of the best professor's I have had. Extremely clear and helpful, and truly a nice guy. I learned a lot, and he really knows what he is talking about. Highly recommend."
14,5.0,4.0, PSYCH245,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,"Dr. Abramowitz is one of the most interesting professors I've ever had ~ really witty and funny.  Learned a lot about abnormal psychology.  We did fun activities in class.  He wants you to do well (you have to study, though).  No regrets taking this class."
15,5.0,3.0, ABNOR001,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JONATHAN,ABRAMOWITZ,"Made abnormal psychology fun and interesting. He had great ""props"" and demonstrations to make classes very hands on."
