1,5.0,1.0, SOC1011,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,"Forgot to rate this class I took it back in the fall but the class was extremely easy. Her lectures are very interesting, pay attention, take good notes, read the textbook and retain the information and you will be set. 

I studied probably 3-4 days before the exams mostly 2 days and got 97+ on the exams. Not a ton of studying and very easy "
2,3.0,2.0, SOC1011,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,"The lectures are very boring bring other homework or classwork to do instead. Tests are extremely difficult if you do not completely understand or read the book. Very nice professor, the class just sucks.   "
3,1.0,4.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,she talks alllll class. doesnt use slide shows for notes. gives an outline for notes and thats all.
4,3.0,2.0, SOC1011,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,Very boring lectures!! Bringing two pillows is a must because you will get tired and fall asleep. Then as time goes by you will need another pillow for your first pillow cause it will get bored and fall asleep. Other than that.... the class is total cake!!!
5,3.0,3.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,Super nice! easy grader and explains the material well! Review handouts helps alot on the exam. Reading is a must!
6,4.0,3.0, SOC100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,"She is really nice and although the class can get boring at times, she tries to make it interesting. She takes attendance at the end of every class. There is a lot of reading every night, but if you listen and take good notes, reading isn't entirely necessary."
7,5.0,2.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,"Pretty easy, but you need to read the textbook and readings from another book. 4 multiple choice tests. Gives occasional extra credit. But who rated her as hot? She looks like a trailer-trash version of Justin Beiber"
8,5.0,2.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,"I ended up loving this class! I called her after the 1st day of class because I was ordered my books off half.com, and I found the same book but different addition. She said ""oh don't worry about it, I have a copy you can borrow!"" She's really fun, helpful, and loves what she teaches, and she does it well. Class discussions are always interesting."
9,2.0,4.0, SOC597,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,Lectures are boring and tests are pretty difficult. A lot of study time is necessary to do well in this class!
10,3.5,2.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,She was a good teacher and she clearly enjoyed what she was teaching. But she has many ADD moments where she go off on some wild subject that has nothing to do with soc. Overall a pretty good class but it can tend to get boring so bring a laptop so you can keep notes organized and when she goes on her rants you can get on fb
11,4.5,2.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,"This class is very interesting. You can tell she loves what she does. She grades fair, and if you listen take notes, and do the reading, you will have an A or B+. Sit in the front of the class, and be there everyday. While attendance is not mandatory, it will help you on test. Most of what you go over in class is on the test. She is very fair!!!"
12,5.0,1.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,so easy
13,5.0,1.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,This class was easy!!!
14,3.5,2.0, SOCIOLOGY101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,"Winnick is a good teacher, although her lectures are boring and her tests are kind of hard, but she is a nice lady."
15,4.0,3.0, SOC,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,"Good teacher, but if you have to take a lot of her classes, it starts to get tedious."
16,5.0,3.0, SOC210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TERRI,WINNICK,"She is a great teacher.  She is funny, flexible, and willing to help students.  Sociology 210 is the most interseting class I have taken during my entire time in college.  I would love to take more classes with Terri."
