1,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JACI,BOWE,I didn't watch any of the lectures. I did 20% of the additional readings and did not read the textbook once. I got an A.
2,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JACI,BOWE,"This course is super simple. If you have a basic understanding of the US legal system this should be a breeze. Just weekly assignments, three exams, and one 4-6 page paper. If you just complete all the work you should get an A. "
3,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JACI,BOWE,"I took this class as an online Diversity GE, and it was very interesting! workload is quite manageable each week as well. One thing I will say that exams make up a large portion of your grade, but those are hardly challenging. Other than that, just weekly discussion posts and 1 paper. Great choice for a GE. "
4,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JACI,BOWE,Easy class. Workload consisted of no more than a weekly discussion post. Book is recommended but not necessary for the class. Midterms are online and open book and not too hard.
5,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JACI,BOWE,"Class was informative but super easy. You get out what you put into it - the lectures and readings are long and interesting, but you really don't need them to do fine with the weekly work. I probably spent like an hour on class each week, plus a couple hours for the final paper. Would recommend."
6,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL4511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JACI,BOWE,"There were 2 papers, 2 exams and 2 discussion posts every week. Class was easy, but I learned so much! I enhoyed professor Bowes lectures and attitude. "
7,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JACI,BOWE,There was one required final paper and 3 exams. There were 2 disscussion posts every week. All exams were extremely easy and open book/note. Professor Bowe was extremely nice and understanding. I enjoyed listening to her lectures. 
8,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JACI,BOWE,"Professor Bowe was amazing! She's an attorney, so she's very knowledgeable about the subject matter and it shows how much she cares about it. Her class is low-maintenance, just a couple short discussion posts a week, one paper, and non-cumulative open-note exams. Easy A and she was engaging even in online lectures."
9,4.0,1.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JACI,BOWE,Online class so I didn't interact with her much.  However she seemed nice and the class is easy.
10,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL4511,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JACI,BOWE,Such an easy A and she is honestly the best! Her lectures are so interesting and there is an extra credit assignment worth 3%. The 2 papers are relatively easy and she is very willing to help and give feedback if you need it. Definitely recommend!!
11,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL2309,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JACI,BOWE,An easy online class. Her lectures were thorough and she made sure everything on the quiz or exam was covered in her recorded lectures
