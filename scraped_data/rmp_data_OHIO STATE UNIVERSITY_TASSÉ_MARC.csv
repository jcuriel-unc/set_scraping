1,2.0,3.0, NEUROSC4550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARC,TASSÉ,"1 Paper, 2 Exams. Each exam had so much content. The exams overall are easy if you can remember 8-9 weeks of content. The lectures are around 50 slides each so each exams has an enormous amount of slides. The class is quite repetitive and you can get lost in the amount of information. Lectures are dry. Paper exams. Only around 2 questions of EC."
2,1.0,5.0, EDUCST7717,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARC,TASSÉ,"Marc taught one class out of 16 weeks. He said the midterm and final ""wouldn't be specific,"" but the tests questions were exactly that.  There were over 2,000 total lecture slides between the exams. He makes sure the guest lectures talk as long as possible. Pointless class. Tough grader. Would NEVER recommend this class or professor to anyone. "
3,1.5,4.0, SW7718,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,MARC,TASSÉ,"I read the assignments, attended all but two classes (illness)and took good notes in class.  Usually that means an A. Prof. Tasse' taught one class in 14 weeks. Was not even there for the final.  Gave only one test--the final on the last day of class with irrelevant questions. I give him an F as a professor."
