1,5.0,2.0, PSYC533,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,GATES,"I love this class! Dr. Gates clearly explains the material and outlines all expectations. She is available and willing to work with you if you have questions and provides great feedback. Great class to learn more in-depth statistics without being punished for a couple of mistakes. Composed of 5 homeworks, 5 quizzes and a final paper/presentation"
2,4.0,4.0, PSYC533,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KATHLEEN,GATES,"This class was a hard one - the quizzes and homework was pretty tough and I had to rewatch lectures multiple times to understand things sometimes. She is super sweet and accessible though! This class is mostly quizzes (6) and homework (5), but there is a major final group project (no final exam)."
