1,1.5,1.0, OPTICS3470,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,WILKINS,"I took the optics elective class he teaches. 1/2 the sem was him lecturing over material we had no background in, the 2nd 1/2 of the sem was presentations by the students (3 each).There was no pleaseing him. He complained and criticized students while most were just as good as his own lecturing. The department is hiding him in a useless class"
2,1.0,5.0, PHYS367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,WILKINS,"His class was the most infuriating class I've taken so far at OSU. He tells you everything you've ever learned ever is wrong and grades you accordingly. Absolutely useless. His lectures are confusing. Switched from an easier grading style to the point system the day after the deadline for dropping a class, half of the class failed as a result."
3,1.0,1.0, PHYS596,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,WILKINS,"His description of Blackbody radiation was not only incomprehensible but also wrong, as are most. He teaches the technical writing classes because he can do less damage there than in a real physics class. Class would improve dramatically if he didn't teach it. Says ""...you see"" too much, even if we dont. Sits in back, then can't see presentations."
