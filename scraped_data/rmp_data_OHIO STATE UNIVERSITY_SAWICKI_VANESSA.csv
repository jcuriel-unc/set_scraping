1,4.0,1.0, SOCPSYCH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,"
This class was very enjoying and I learned a lot from it. We rarely had homework and honestly, I finished most of the week's work in an hour. Definitely recommend taking ay class you can with this professor.

2,1.0,5.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,"Do NOT take a class with Sawicki. When I had a family emergency, she essentially told me that I needed to have done the work on time and turn it in on time. Very few chances to get your grade up if you miss a discussion/reflection. Will be petitioning for grade forgiveness and taking class with any other intro professor. AVOID IF ABLE"
3,1.0,5.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,"Sawicki is by far the worst professor I have ever had. She is incredibly rude, and does not provide any detailed feedback, no matter if she claims she did.  She is a horrible grader, she is extremely strict and only gives you the link to the rubric as ""feedback"". AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!"
4,1.0,3.0, PYSCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,She is kinda rude and goes back on her work
5,1.0,3.0, PSYCH2376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,She doesnt allow any technology in her class room despite the university providing us with iPads and encouraging us to use them. So I everything for my classes on the iPad except for this class. She docked my grade twice for one paper.
6,5.0,4.0, PSYCH2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,"The greatest prof. I have ever had. It is clear what she expects from you so if you do what she says, the classes are pretty easy. If you take notes from her power points, there is no reason you shouldn't do well on the exams. She is younger, so I think that she understands the students more. Always willing to help, or just talk if you want."
7,4.0,4.0, 2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,"She's very specific on what she expects in the papers. If you follow along with the rubrics given, you will do well. Proofread your papers SEVERAL times. The papers are not long, but she doesn't like what she calls ""word fat."" Exams are written, but she provides a study guide and those were helpful. If you go to class and study, you will do fine."
8,2.0,4.0, 2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,"Not many points available, only 200 for the whole Social Psych class, yet a tough grader and she even said ""you won't get 100% on some papers"". No extra credit available. I found myself struggling to get every point I could. "
9,5.0,4.0, SOCIALPSYCH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,"I too am an untraditional student, and I really enjoy Vanessa's class. You know what to expect and where you stand. Put the required work in and you'll be fine. She challenges you in hopes that you will learn something. She is really nice and offers help if needed through email, office hours or after class. "
10,5.0,4.0, SOCPSYCH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,"Vanessa is great, she spells out the expectations in the beginning, if you aren't up to it, drop. Class and lectures are enjoyable, be prepared to be challenged and actually learn something. Very aproachable, wants your patricipsation and feedback. As untraditional student, I find her class enjoyable! Notes are clear, tells you what to write down. "
11,1.0,5.0, SOCIALPSYCH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,"This prof has unrealistic demands and expectations. I wonder if she realizes we are full time students. She is picky and sensitive about everything. Between quizzes after EVERY chapter and writing 7 papers, and one big paper and the midterms--which you have to take meticulous notes because she makes it clear she won't provide you with any. Run!"
12,3.5,3.0, 14086,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VANESSA,SAWICKI,"Three quizzes, three exams. Final exam is noncumulative. Very direct and to the point. Randomly passes around a sign-in sheet to gauge attendance. NOTE: If you're under 18, you have to write EIGHT summaries of research papers to get research credit (10% of grade). If you're over 18, you get to participate in experiments for that credit instead. "
