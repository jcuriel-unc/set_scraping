1,2.0,5.0, PYSCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,BRUNELL,"Totally don't recommend her for a professor. For goodness sake, it is an introduction to psychology class and it's extremely intense for no reason. Her lectures make no sense and she doesn't give good criteria as to what the test would be like. Avoid her if you can...."
2,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3530,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,BRUNELL,"She is simply amazing! Her lectures are very good, and fun to listen to. She gives plenty of extra credit opportunities throughout the semester. She genuinely cares about her students and how well you do in the class/ how well you understand the material. She makes herself very available to talk to students outside of class."

4,5.0,4.0, PSYCH2376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,BRUNELL,"Dr. Brunell is my favorite professor. Her lectures are interesting and engaging, and she communicates the course material clearly. Her exams are tough, but she gives you all the tools needed to prepare (study guides, power-points, etc). "
5,4.5,5.0, PSYCH543,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,BRUNELL,Brunell is one of the best professors I have ever had.  Her exams are the hards exams I have ever taken.  She is very challenging professor.  If you take her for any class make sure you study and then study some more.

8,5.0,3.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,BRUNELL,Great class. I learned a lot about myself and useful things that I will use in my relationships. Tests were challenging but the assignments and project were fun to do.
9,4.0,3.0, PYSCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,BRUNELL,"She's pretty nice, does all the lecture through powerpoint.  Exams are very tricky."
10,2.0,5.0, PSYCH543,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,AMY,BRUNELL,I don't know if it was the class or her but psych of women just got completely out of hand and she just let them argue she did say anything to get us back to learning
