1,3.0,2.0, POLI448,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,"Professor Marks was a pretty solid teacher. He was really passionate about the material and was willing to talk outside of class. The class itself wasn't very hard. Your grade comes from attendance/participation, a presentation or a debate (your choice), a final paper, and a midterm and final there were both take home. Attendance is mandatory."
2,5.0,2.0, POLI70,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,Professor Marks is a fantastic lecturer and cares very much for his students. While the class was writing/essay heavy he gives students all the necessary resources to succeed in the class. And his worldly perspective and experiences makes learning from him even more enjoyable.
3,5.0,2.0, POLI433H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,"Professor Marks is incredible - he is obviously very knowledgeable on the subject (he's legitimately famous in the worldwide POLI community) and incredibly easy going. He has pretty clear cut grading criteria, and I feel like he takes into consideration the effort you put into the work when grading. Overall, he's an amazing professor - take him."
4,5.0,3.0, POLI630,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,"He is the best professor I have ever had at UNC. He lectures a lot, but they're actually really interesting. He is incredibly nice, will get back to you ASAP, always willing to meet with you, and is very positive. He harshly critiques writing, but doesn't necessarily take points off because of it - he just wants you to be a better writer. Love him."
5,5.0,2.0, POLI433H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,"Great Poli lecturer. He's an expert in European politics, and is very well-connected with post-grad and international opportunities. I've taken two of his classes! Fairly easy A if you do your work, and Prof. Marks genuinely cares about your success and you as a person. He was very understanding about COVID circumstances. Class is lecture heavy."
6,5.0,4.0, POLI433H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,Prof Marks is seriously like the smartest professor I have ever had. He's a legitimately famous political scientist & it's a privilege to take a class w him. Weekly debates were interesting. He tends to monologue during discussion but honestly I loved hearing what he had to say so no complaints from me. Plz take a class w him if you can!!
7,5.0,2.0, POLI66,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,"Professor Marks is a credit to his profession. Passionate and knowledgeable lectures combined with personal anecdotes allowed for an excellent classroom experience. Marks was a reasonable grader and understanding teacher, and I greatly enjoyed my time spent in his classroom"
8,5.0,2.0, POLI70,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,A brilliant political scientist. His class is a real treat for those who have a particular interest in European politics. Lectures are woven with British wit and very informative experiences from Dr. Marks -- his stories of doing research during the Cold War are particularly intriguing. He had a clear system of grading with feedback.
9,5.0,2.0, POLI70,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,"Fairly easy A. He's British & his stories were awesome. (Ask him about his time in East Berlin!) His wife is also an awesome Poli professor, and we interacted with her too. Doesn't allow electronics, and lectures sometimes got a little long, but overall I would definitely take a class with him again."
10,4.0,4.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,"I loved Marks and his lectures. His insight to all things European was very helpful as well. However, his TA did all the grading (Dave Attewell), and he graded very harshly."
11,3.0,4.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,"Professor Marks is a good prof. He engages with the class and works hard to explain materials. he cancelled class frequently due to travel, which was nice. However, there are only 3 grades, and they are all graded by the TA. Dave Attewell was our TA and he graded very difficult. Take a class with Marks if there is no TA, and Avoid Dave Attewell!"
12,4.0,3.0, POLI239,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,GARY,MARKS,"Professor Marks is incredibly smart and well known.  His class is lecture based and there are only 3 grades - midterm, paper, and final.  Depends on the TA as far as the grading, but Professor Marks does a good job of explaining and promoting discussion"
