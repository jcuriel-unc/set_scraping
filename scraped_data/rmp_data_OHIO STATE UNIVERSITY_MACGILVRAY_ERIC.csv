1,5.0,4.0, PS3001,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,Definitley one of the best classes I have taken at OSU. Professor MacGilvray is very likeable and keeps his lectures engaging. It's easy for me to get bored & distracted in classes but I never was for this one. He also gives constructive feedback on papers and really sets you up to do well on exams.
2,4.0,4.0, PS2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"Don't let the 2xxx level fool you-- this class is tough. You will have to come to class and pay attention to know what's going on. Your grade is 90% exams, but they're fair. If you put the work in, it's not awful. Eric is a really nice guy , engaging in class, and is always willing to help you out if you're lost."
3,5.0,5.0, POLSC2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"Funniest teacher I've ever had. This class was also very difficult... Based on three written exams. If you tank one, like I did because of a nasty breakup, you can't fully recover from it. Still, his class was ridiculously entertaining, and I learned a lot. I still frequently reference texts I read in this class. Accessible/ helpful outside class."
4,3.0,4.0, PS3430,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,He is funny and his lectures were pretty entertaining but sometimes no matter how hard I tried I still had trouble understanding what we were talking about. I think political theory might just be a difficult subject in general. I wish he would have been more clear with what we were supposed to take away from each reading.
5,5.0,4.0, PS3430,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"I have taken two classes with MacGilvray now and he is TOUGH, there is not argument from there, but it is worth it. Even if you do not fully understand the reading, he goes over it in class knowing full well they are confusing af sometimes. Honestly, going to class for his horrific/hilarious board drawings is just worth it in itself."
6,5.0,4.0, POLISC2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"Professor MacGilvray is not only an amazing professor but also a great human being. His class is very inspiring and very heavily test-based but he does curve the score to your advantage every time. However you dont have to be worried about the tests as long as your pay attention in class, take careful notes and make flash cards for test studies."
7,4.0,4.0, POLSC2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"ok, so this class all depends on the students that are in it. Ive heard some really cringey comments in this class. since he offers credit for participation youll have a lot of annoying freshmen trying to kiss his ass. grading is very vague. class isnt easy, but the prof is very likable."
8,5.0,4.0, PS2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"Dr. MacGilvray is amazing, but the class is definitely hard. It's totally worth it, but you have to study, and take really detailed notes during class (look out for buzz words!). His class consists of three exams, each worth 30% of your grade, and 5 pop quizzes (lowest one dropped), for the remaining 10%. He's really funny and intelligent."
9,5.0,4.0, PS2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,He is great. You do a lot of reading but then go over it in class. Hes very engaging and does a lot of funny things to keep it interesting. Great guy.
10,5.0,4.0, POLI2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"Most engaging and entertaining professor I've ever had. Always willing to answer questions and makes sure students understand the material. The chalk throwing never got old. Not many professors leave a lasting impact on me, but Professor MacGilvray definitely did in such a positive way!"
11,5.0,4.0, POLSC2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,Fantastic!!!!
12,5.0,4.0, POLSC2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"It's entirely possible to get an A in this class - but it won't come easy. There's lots of reading, and it's important to know how to tie all the concepts together. It's a good class and I've learned a lot, but it requires effort."
13,4.0,3.0, POLITSC2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,Great class! He is very hyper and that makes the material enjoyable to learn.
14,5.0,3.0, POLSC5413,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"I'm in my last year, and Dr. MacGilvray has easily been my favorite professor at OSU. He doesn't have powerpoint slides or even any detailed notes. His class is very discussion based and he uses it to explain some very dense readings. it's definitely not an easy class, but it's truly opened my eyes to so much in the field of Political Science."
15,4.0,4.0, POLITSC2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"The first week you may think that since there is no homework, you can skip and pass no problem... you'd be wrong. The detail in the lectures that he provides cannot be made up by attending the review seasons. Theres is no way to fake your way through his tests. Lots of reading required but it becomes easier to understand after discussion."
16,4.0,3.0, POLITSC2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"Throws chalk every time he references something on the board, very funny in lecture, very clear about exams"
17,3.5,4.0, PS3430,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"Pop quizzes over readings.  Only two other grades, a midterm and a final where you just write everything you can possibly remember.  He had no clear criteria for the assessments so you have no idea what he wants or where you went wrong, but did give a study guide, and curved well.  He's an amazing lecturer, though.  Review sessions are a must."
18,4.5,4.0, POLI2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"One of the hardest classes i've ever taken. His test format is absolutely brutal and if your mind has a tendency to wander like mine does, its really tough. But if you pay attention to everything he says and do the readings, you'll be okay"
19,3.5,5.0, POLITSC2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,"Theory can be difficult, this much is true, but sometimes it feels like Prof. MacGilvray makes it as difficult as possible. Class is dragged on by his harsh implementation of the Socratic method, there are no slides/notes so you MUST attend, he gives pop quizzes constantly, and tests are a nightmare. Glad I like this stuff and at least he's nice."
20,2.0,4.0, POLITSCI2400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIC,MACGILVRAY,DO NOT TAKE POLITICAL THEORY FROM HIM!!! his test are so abstract and our harvard law graduate/TA struggles to grade and understand him. He's very entertaining but also very insane. good luck
