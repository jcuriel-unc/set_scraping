1,4.0,3.0, PSYC550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,His lectures were really interesting and you can tell he's passionate about childhood psychology. He was very charismatic during lectures and it was easy to pay attention. His tests were relatively easy if you paid attention and took good notes. Some things on the test were things he only said in lecture but weren't in the slides or book. 
2,3.0,5.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,"Nice guy, lectures were interesting. Reading the textbook is important and theres a lot of it"
3,4.0,3.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,"He's really passionate about psychology so lectures are pretty engaging. A lot of the material you need to know comes from the book, so you should stay on top of textbook reading. For studying DEFINITELY DEFINITELY do the review questions, from each module that are in carmen, the questions really are similar to the tests. Absolutely do the REP xtra"
4,3.0,5.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,Opfer is a nice guy who's really passionate about psych but his class lacks any real structure and he gives little to instruction on any of the graded assignment. Exams are only multiple choice and theres a retake but prepare for the worst because he gives you a study guide with basic terms and then test on super specific topics. So much READING!!!
5,5.0,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,He is very passionate about the material and tries to get everyone interested. He posts multiple choice reviews on his website that are very useful because they are very similar to the test (some of the same questions). The grades were based on several exams and a paper. His expectations are clear.
6,4.0,3.0, PSYCH100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,My favorite professor during my first semester at OSU. There is a lot of reading and I would recommend keeping up with it (instead of reading everything before each exam like I did). Strongly suggest going to every class. He reads from the slides on his website but keeps it interesting. Also throws in facts that are used as extra-credit on exams.
7,3.0,1.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,"He doesn't post anything online so don't lose your syllabus. He doesn't remind you to do the REP even once so if you lose your one paper copy of the syllabus, you won't know how to do it and your grade will drop 10%. Exams are easy just do the ""review"" things and don't bother studying anything else."
8,4.0,3.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,"Good professor. Made the lectures exciting and worth going to. A lot of textbook/book reading for a gen ed, but otherwise very interesting."
9,4.0,1.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,"The honors version is easier than the regular intro to psych. You don't have to do as much out of class work, and the exams are incredibly easy. The questions are taken directly from some of the practice quizzes for each section, and he offers a retake for each exam, where he reuses questions. The final just takes questions from previous exams."
10,2.5,1.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,"I went to one class. I read the book and did his practice problems. Got an A. The material was far too easy for him to bother teaching, and he recycles his exams. It seemed to me he didn't care--he had more important classes to worry about."
11,3.5,2.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,Not a terribly hard class if you attend lecture and skim the book.  Opfer is a great lecturer and really likes psychology.
12,3.0,3.0, PSYCH1100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,"Heard he was easy, so I took his class. It was really boring and class was pointless as all his powerpoints were online and they took things directly from the book. Seriously just read the book to take the tests. Retake tests if you can for the extra opp, it's nice. IF YOU SKIP DO NOT FALL BEHIND ON READING. that's what I did"
13,4.5,3.0, PSY101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,This was a really good choice for an introductory level Psych class. Opfer is hilarious and always willing to help or answer questions. All of the slides are online and you can retake two midterms.
14,4.5,2.0, PSYCH100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,Professor Opfer is extremely helpful and funny! Always willing to help and tries his best to make classes interesting. You can also retake two midterms! He is such an awesome instructor for this introductory course!
15,5.0,2.0, PSYCH101H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,"No clue WHAT these terrible reviews are about. Dr. Opfer was outstanding. Allows you to retake midterms; learn all the vocab from the first midterm & you'll ace the retake. Final is repeat midterm questions plus a LITTLE new material. Passionate about his work and a fun guy. I'm not a psych major, but I LOVED the class and aced it."
16,5.0,2.0, PSYCH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,I really enjoyed Dr. Opfer's class; you can tell he is passionate about his work. He also had a good sense of humor and a pleasant personality. The book was very good; I read it and didn't think the exam was hard. You are not graded for attendance but you'll enjoy participating in his class.
17,4.0,2.0, PSYCH100H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,He's a good teacher who keeps classes interesting with stories and humor. Tests are fairly easy and you get to retake them and take the better score. Good teacher to have for this class
18,2.5,4.0, PSYC550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,"Tells you to study the powerpoints which are very general, but then there are questions about neuroscience on the test. He expects you to know the most minute details about the material, he takes the fun out of psychology. Full of himself, not very helpful. AVOID THIS CLASS"
19,2.5,5.0, PSYCH340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,Dr. Opfer is one of the worst instructors ever. His tests are never what you think they'll be. He expects you to think at his level. If you try to go to him in person to get help he's intimidating and he doesn't want to help you improve. Exams are based primarily on examples and experiments presented in textbook and on powerpoint slides.
20,4.0,5.0, PSYCHH550,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JOHN,OPFER,"While this class is not easy, it is worth the effort. Opfer is extremely intelligent and he is full of info. I think he communicates the material clearly and his examples stick in your mind. He does not hand out grades, you have to earn them. I got an A by reading all of the material, attending every class and studying my ass off."
