1,3.0,1.0, POLI434,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,Poli 434 was a very easy class. 55% of the grade came from either attendance or assignments that were graded on completion. She takes attendance but does so randomly. As long as you show up to class and turn things in you will get an A or an A-.
2,3.0,3.0, POLI434,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"She lectured a lot and would go off on tangents that meant we didn't cover all the material in class. Her lectures were also a little hard to follow at times. Overall tho, I learned a lot abt Mexican politics and feel informed enough to speak on current events. She gives lots of little low-stakes assignments. Its a lot of work but not too hard."
3,5.0,2.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"I absolutely loved profesora Martinez-Gallardo. She is so passionate about Latin American politics, and was so so kind. I'm taking her POLI-434 course this Spring, and I'm super excited! "
4,1.0,3.0, POLI434,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"Tedious lectures. Irresponsive professor. We didn't know any of our grades until right after the final. Pretty disorganized as well. Easy material, but the grading style was a little odd. "
5,5.0,2.0, POLI434,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"The absolute cutest. I love this woman. She's so caring, kind, and involved. Really stresses mental health and learning to learn, very flexible. Totally recommend her Poli 238 (latin america) or Poli 434 (mexico)!"
6,4.0,2.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"She is clearly passionate and knowledgeable about Latin American politics, and that can come through by means of information overload - she sometimes gets lost in all the things she wants to say. However, she is very sweet, clearly cares about her students, and will give you plenty of opportunities to bring your grade up. Easy grader!"
7,4.0,1.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"Gallardo-Martinez is super sweet, caring, and understanding. Lots of extra credit. Pretty easy course. Lecture heavy. Overall, pretty ok course, which I enjoyed it more."
8,4.0,4.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"Professor was respectful, knowledgeable, and understanding. This class is a good foundation for contemporary Latin American politics. Readings for this class were accessible, and the due dates were clear as well. I would suggest paying attention to the readings and studying reading questions will prepare you other topics and exams."
9,4.0,2.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"Super sweet, caring, and loves the topic. I recommend taking this class especially if you're a Poli Sci major! Cons: readings can be long, exams have few questions (but are fairly easy), she's a little disorganized and can get off topic Overall I def liked it, lots of EC, interesting topics, sweet woman!!!"
10,5.0,3.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,Great professor. CMG was always willing to help and her class was very engaging.
11,2.0,1.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"CMG shifted the class so that 35% of course grade comes from participation--which I think was supposed to make it easier (given COVID), but actually just culminated in the expectation that you do like 100 forum posts over the course of the semester. The whole class is tedious busy work and is not very interesting. Take HIST 242 with M. La Serna."
12,5.0,2.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"CMG is great! very kind and caring during COVID times. Lectures can drag if you're not interested in the material, but the content is very interesting! Midterm and Short paper and Final not too difficult. Discussion posts before every class."
13,5.0,4.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"She's truly amazing! In COVID times, she really understood that her class couldn't always be a mental priority for us. The class is very much based on paying attention to the notes so you get out of the class what you put in. The exams are very straightforward if you pay attention. I adore Prof. Mart√≠nez Gallardo as an instructor and as a person."
14,4.0,2.0, POLI434,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,She really cares about her students' mental health and is not a harsh grader. I managed an A in both the midterm & final and studied 1hr for each. So long as you keep up w the little assignments it's not a difficult class! She's a great person in general & very knowledgeable about the content
15,5.0,2.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,A gem. She is very understanding of Covid plus gave us days where we chose to make class optional because of outside factors. Knows sooo much about Latin America. Participate and do the discussion questions and you should be good. Her paper is easy and midterm was quite simple. Overall a great professor.
16,4.0,2.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"great professor, sometimes a bit unclear but was always willing to answer questions. willing to stay after class. a bit hard to reach at times. PARTICIPATE in class discussions, she really cares about that. nice person who was willing to work with you if you had issues. if you do the readings, and the assignments (not many) you should be fine"
17,5.0,3.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"CMG is a real gem! Although this semester was hectic with things moving online due to COVID-19, she always made sure to let students know that she was available. Her lectures are engaging and even though the reading can be extensive at times, it is interesting if you enjoy Latin American politics. One paper, participation, a midterm, and a final."
18,4.0,3.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"She is a nice teacher, and is very passionate about the material. Her grading rubric is clear, 25% participation, 25% midterm, 25% paper, and 25% final. If you skim the readings and take notes in class, you'll do fine."
19,4.0,3.0, POLI434,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,"Prof. Gallardo's class was impactful and engaging. She isn't always clear about what readings you need to be doing, but you definitely don't need to do all of them, just pay attention to her lectures. Her exams were difficult but the subject matter was fascinating and she really knows her stuff. All in all a very nice woman and cool professor."
20,3.0,3.0, POLI238,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CECILIA,MARTINEZ-GALLARDO,I cannot stress how there are only four grades in the entire class. You cannot do bad on one assignment if you want to do well in the class. The subject matter is very interesting but CMG seems very out-of-it in class. She gets off topic quickly and very often. Lectures were long and often boring. Don't take unless needed for your major.
