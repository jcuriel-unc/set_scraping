1,5.0,4.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,WIRTH,"Dr. Wirth is a really great professor. His class is slightly difficult. Take good notes, you should do fine. Gives pop quizzes so make sure to study a lot. He is a funny guy and relates material he teaches to his life, which makes it easier to understand the material. He cares about his students and wants you to pass."
2,3.0,3.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,WIRTH,Gives really good lectures . He tries to be funny ... but at least he tries. He makes remembering easier by giving us real work examples. Pop quizzes got to me but I had a chance to do some extra credit work and he will change your quiz grades to a 10/10. Exams are based off of applying what we learned to examples.
3,4.0,4.0, PSYCH2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,WIRTH,Overall a great guy. Interesting class for 8am and he knows his material. Just pay attention.
4,1.0,4.0, PSYCH1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,WIRTH,"Great person in general and professor in general, but do not recommend this class to anyone who has bad study habits. Pop Quizzes will sneak up on you. Exams are worded very difficult, so you must study and know what you are learning. Lectures can be long and boring on most days."
5,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3375,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,WIRTH,Nice guy but not a great professor. The exams are ridiculously confusing! Please do not take any course with him unless you want trick question exams and a class with so little points that it is almost impossible to receive an A.
6,2.0,3.0, 2300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,WIRTH,"This class would have been a lot easier if he wasn't the professor. Every time he had to explain an assignment, he barely ever made sense. The whole class was confused during 90% of the assignments. Other than that, his power-points were very helpful. I dropped the class because he was too confusing of a professor. "
7,3.5,4.0, 1100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,WIRTH,"If you can learn through reading a text book then, this would be a good class for you. Good professor, very clear lectures, but if you don't read you won't pass."
8,4.0,3.0, 1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JAMES,WIRTH,"He's a pretty funny guy, just because you know he thought of his jokes the night before so he could say them in class. So it's an entertaining class. When it comes to the class material, he knows what he's talking about and tries his absolute hardest to make sure you know the material while he's teaching. He also expects you to read all of the mods"
