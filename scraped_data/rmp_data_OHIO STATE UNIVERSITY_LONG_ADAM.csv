1,4.0,4.0, SOC3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"Dr. Long is very passionate about what he teaches, so even though it can be very boring, he does his best to make it interesting. There were 12 quizzes, 4 exams, a very strict no technology policy, and attendance is mandatory. He sets very clear expectations for the class which is nice. If you put in the work/pay attention, then you should be ok."
2,5.0,3.0, SOC3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,Amazing prof and engaging/ hilarious lectures. Long readings (40-80+ pgs) that go with 12 quizzes that make up the majority of your grade. The class & prof seems intimidating at first but is actually quite easy and fun if you put the work in to study and pay attention during lecture. Has a strict no technology policy so be prepared to write notes.
3,3.0,4.0, Sociol1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"I would highly recommend this course for those interested in sociology or who see themselves furthering their education in the subject. For people like myself, who are just trying to fulfill a course requirement this professor is not for that. This course is lecture heavy. FYI: 10 points are taken from your following exam per class missed."
4,4.0,5.0, SOC3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"He is a great teacher that a lot of people really won't like. Not an accommodating prof, but if you work hard, read everything, and don't get distracted, you will learn so much from his fluid, knowledgeable lectures. If you want an easy A, take someone else, if you love theory and are legitimately interested, take him. 4 exams, 13 quizzes "
5,5.0,4.0, Sociol1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"Pros
-Well-researched and passionate about sociology
-Humorous/interesting lectures (subjective)
-Grades are usually representative of effort
-Gives subtle hints for the test in lecture

Cons
-Rigid grades + fast-paced lectures
-Difficult tests
-Tedious readings (~40 pages/week)
-Extreme work load compared to other professors that teach intro socio"
6,1.0,5.0, SOC3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"Dr. Long's teaching style is not for all. First, he doesn't allow any electronics in his class, so no phones, ipads, or computers to take notes. Second, if the 27 page syllabus doesn't scare you, tests being worth 200 points will. Be prepared for quizzes due on a random tuesday at 8 pm (really dumb time that makes it so ppl forget about it). :("
7,5.0,5.0, SOC3306,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,Professor Long has a phenomenal understanding of what he teaches.  It is up to the student / class to be engaged.  There is a lot to learn from his expertise.
8,1.0,5.0, SOC5629,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"Adam Long was the worst professor I ever took. His exams are unnecessarily complicated. He has a savior complex thing, where he thinks he is accommodating but he is not. You have to always show up to class or he will take 10 points off your exam. If you have the option to take another professor for this class please do."
9,4.0,5.0, SOC3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"I feel like he is unfairly criticized.  Yes, he can come off as demeaning as times but his lectures are extremely informative and I learned a lot.  You can tell he is very passionate about what he teaches and if you take good notes and study you should be fine.  Note that there is a lot of reading every week."
10,4.0,5.0, SOCIOL3463H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"You learn so much from Dr. Long if you actually do the things youre supposed to do. If you dont, the class is hard and would definitely suck"
11,3.0,5.0, SOC3467,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,Class was far too much work for a 3 credit hour/3000 level class. I wasn't prepared to spend so much time on it so I ended up with my lowest grade in college ever. He is a passionate teacher but it was so hard to take this class online. Listened to 3+ hours of lectures/week + hours of reading. Tests used Proctorio which is bad for anxious people.
12,5.0,4.0, SOC3306,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"I took this class in AU20 but i noticed all the negative reviews and thoroughly disagree. As long as you attend class, study even for a couple days before the exam (I recommend more), read the assigned readings, then you should do fine. Intensive professor but you learn a lot. He is quite knowledgeable on sociology. May be best for soc majors tbh. "
13,5.0,4.0, SOC3467,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"This is the second course I have taken with Dr. Long, the first being SOC3306. Many are rating him quite unfairly. Yes, the classes are difficult and he expects you to read and study thoroughly but I cant help but feel the people complaining are used to very laid back soc pedagogy. This class forces you to actually learn and you will learn a lot"
14,5.0,4.0, SOCIOL3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,Not sure why he has such low ratings. I think Adam Long is an amazing professor. Throughly explains the material is a way for students to understand. He is one of the best lecturing professors I have encountered so far at OSU. He doesnt just read from the slides like most professors and really engages with the class.
15,1.0,5.0, AU5629,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"This prof has been the worst experience of teaching I have had at Ohio State, I can see why the guy makes less than $20 bucks an hour. Expected to read over seventy pages of information a week, then only asks you ten specific questions over the entirety of the chapters. Tests are just as convoluted."
16,1.0,4.0, SOC3467,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,The class is listed as a 3000 level course but could easily be a 4000 level course. He requires students to make a discussion post and take a quiz once a week and has 4 tests. Easily one of my least favorite professors
17,4.0,4.0, SOC3467,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"I really enjoyed this course, especially the lectures! The weekly assignments are easy, as long as you read the text and follow the syllabus. There's a lot of material to cover, though, and the exams are incredibly challenging! This was an online course, but Dr. Long was accessible and he always responded quickly to my emails."
18,2.0,4.0, SOCIOL5450,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"Took the class SP21. Always responds to emails with no help at all, just a grouchy retort. Never accessible outside of office hours. Does not actually care about students and never seems to have any sympathy whatsoever. Tests are weighted TOO highly on the grading scale for the class. I have not had a positive experience with him thus far."
19,3.0,4.0, SOCIOL5629,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"Preface: Took the class online during SP21 as well as SOCIOL5450. He is not flexible at all, even though he thinks he really is (and will constantly tell you he is). Difficult tests (too many points for tests), unique learning style that doesn't really line up with mine, material was all given to me so that was nice- good PPT's. Lots of reading."
20,1.0,4.0, SOC3488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ADAM,LONG,"Avoid at all cost! Terrible communication, send out maybe one announcement all semester. Takes days to respond to emails & is incredibly condescending. Test questions intentionally worded to confuse you which drops your grade on material you know. You basically have to teach yourself the entire course. Made my fav subject a miserable nightmare."
