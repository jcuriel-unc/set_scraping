1,4.0,3.0, PUBHBIO2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KELLIE,ARCHER,"Dr. Archer is very kind and makes an effort to get to know all of the students. She's very interested in helping students, and the class is easy enough if you do all the assignments. There are online lectures weekly that are used for the quizzes, and a final poster project that builds throughout the semester. I would recommend taking Dr. Archer."
