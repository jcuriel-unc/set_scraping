1,5.0,4.0, PSYCH340,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,PAGE,He is a very good professor. He knows what he is teaching and enjoys it.
2,2.5,4.0, PSYC367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,PAGE,"Dr. Page is a good teacher, he's just not clear on exactly what he wants or when he wants it done. There is a paper due in this class and he never gives an exact date on when it's due, so it's up to you! Attendance isn't required, but it is very helpful!"

4,5.0,1.0, PSYCH100,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROGER,PAGE,Very animated-- which keeps class interesting. Or it would if I didn't have all this stuff in high school psych. That's an intro for you I guess... Easy enough.
