1,3.0,3.0, PSYC490,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BARBARA,FREDRICKSON,One of the top scholars in her field. Very knowledgeable. Class was based on lectures and reading/discussing papers. You'll gain a good command of the positive psych literature by the end. Pretty easy A but a lot of little assignments to keep track of. Class was disorganized at first but this is the first time she's run PSYC490.
2,2.0,3.0, PSYC62,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BARBARA,FREDRICKSON,"6 papers you write and she grades very hard. If you don't write the way she wants, she won't give you a good grade. Don't read the books its a waste of time. Overall Barb is a good lecturer, but the material at times can be quite boring. On the plus side there aren't any tests or quizes."
3,5.0,3.0, PSYC062,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,BARBARA,FREDRICKSON,"Barb was a special teacher to have for a FYS as a Freshmen. She is a world leader in the Positive Psych field and through reading her books and engaging in hands on positivity interventions. You will not have to worry about getting the A as long as you participate in class and not slack off. If you have the opportunity, you need to take Barb!!"
