1,5.0,2.0, POLITSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,Professor Mitzen is probably one of my favorite professors at OSU so far. She really cares about her students and is great at creating really informative conversations in class. Highly recommend taking a class with her!
2,4.0,5.0, POLITSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"This professor as a person was amazing. Very inspirational, but the course overall is difficult if youre just taking this for a GE Credit. She is always willing to help out after hours and during office hours. You could utilize her expertise efficiently, especially as a newbie to the polisci world. She would make things easier for you if you ask."
3,4.0,3.0, POLITSC4330,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,Standard upper division IR course except this one comes with frequent reading quizzes that consist of vague questions worth 0.5 pts each for a total of 3/4 pts per quiz.
4,5.0,3.0, PSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"Professor Mitzen is a really kind Professor and is genuinely passionate about her teachings. I didnt think the homework was too overbearing and the quizzes were pretty easy. Towards the end of the semester some of the classes got a little boring, but the material was presented well."
5,5.0,3.0, PSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"Professor Mitzen did an excellent job handling the course during the pandemic. It was very easy to learn the material, and her lectures were engaging throughout the semester. This class has a lot of assignments of varied type (essays, quizzes, etc), but no assignment ever felt like it was busywork."
6,5.0,2.0, POLITSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"Professor Mitzen is SUCH a genuine and helpful woman. Really knowledgable about global politics and wants to make sure her students don't just do well in the class, but gain a true understanding of the topic. The class had a decent amount of writing assignments, but they were all doable; class takes effort but an A isn't hard to achieve."
7,5.0,5.0, POLITSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"Very inspired by her work. She is always excited and ready to talk about politics. As someone who isnt interested in politics, i was made a little interested because of this professor"
8,4.0,4.0, POLITSC4330,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"Mitzen is a nice person and knowledgable prof but there are just TOO many assignments in this class. Movie responses, papers, short essays, group projects, etc. I feel like with all the stuff she throws at you it's hard to keep your head above water, especially in the midst of a pandemic."
9,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4330,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"Professor Mitzen is a great professor. Shes obviously very knowledgeable about what she teaches, and shes very kind and understanding. Only complaint is that there are a lot of papers- it seems like theres always something due for this class, especially in the second half."
10,2.0,4.0, PS4330,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"This is the most boring political science class I have ever taken. Lectures are very boring and she delivers everything as if it's incredibly profound, but it just doesn't make sense. Work level is manageable, papers aren't too bad, and there is a big group project/simulation at the end. Would be bearable if lecture wasn't so boring."
11,3.0,4.0, POLITSCI4330,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"I've never had any professor throw as much work at me in one class. Usually they pick a medium: tests, papers, group projects, movies, quizzes-- No In this class, its all of the above. I am drowning. 6 papers total. have to watch 2 movies. big group simulation. the content is fascinating but i can't keep my head above water with her expectations."
12,3.0,3.0, PSC4330,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,She was alright. She gives you the whole test to review a week before each exam. There's reading quizzes and group work so you kinda need to go to class. My main issue was she didn't use much visual aid; you really need to be a good auditory learner to succeed in class. I liked the movie-viewing hw! She seems pretty passionate about IR.
13,2.0,2.0, PSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"She did not count any of our exam grades towards our final grade so our final grade literally consisted for two 5 point papers and a 14 point syllabus quiz, so studying for hours for each exam was a WASTE and I ended with a lower grade than I would have had those exams actually COUNTED.. but hey it's good for the people who failed the exams i guess"
14,4.0,3.0, PSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"A great professor, but it's sometimes hard to concentrate because it is all lecture-based and can be boring. Make sure to go to lecture and take notes because there are lecture questions on the exams. Generally gives you what is going to be on tests, which is helpful."
15,4.0,3.0, PSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"Dr. Mitzen was pretty middle of the road for me. The class was really dry even for someone who loves Political Science, but she's super straightforward about what she wants you to know and what the exams will look like. Don't take this if you aren't interested in PoliSci, but if you are you should find this relatively easy."
16,5.0,3.0, PSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"Mitzen is a great professor who is passionate about global politics. Buying the book is necessary, although you do not have to read 100% of it--but very helpful to read in preparation for an exam."
17,4.0,3.0, PSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"GO TO CLASS. It's not hard, but there aren't notes online and they ask questions on exams about things discussed in lecture. There are 3 exams and 2 short papers, no homework. The book is helpful. My only complaint is her lack of visual aids. No powerpoints or notes, just her talking and writing on the board. Don't take if you can't auditory learn."
18,4.0,1.0, PSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,"She is so amazing!! I love this woman. She is so smart and helpful, and is so great to just talk to about life. She is so clear in lectures and very engaging. I used the textbook in this class purely as a study aid for when I had to miss class-- attend lectures and office hours and you will get an A!"
19,5.0,3.0, PSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,Jennifer Mitzen was an amazing professor for the Political Science 1300 course. She gave unbiased lectures and represented all sides of global arguments.  If you are looking for a great teacher who is willing to help you learn then you should consider anything taught by Professor Mitzen.
20,4.0,3.0, PSC1300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,JENNIFER,MITZEN,Really clear lectures with outlines available online. Super important to show up to class and at the very least skim the book. Prepare for the tests using the study guide she gives a week in advance and its pretty hard not to do well.
