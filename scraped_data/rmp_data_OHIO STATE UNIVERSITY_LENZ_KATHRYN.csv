1,2.0,3.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"She is incredibly condescending to anyone who dares ask a question in her class. It feels like she tries to make people feel bad and not smart enough. Additionally, her exam questions are poorly worded and she frequently makes mistakes on her own answer key for the exam so your score is never right. "
2,3.0,3.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"3 midterms (lowest is dropped), one final, one research assignment, and weekly in-class activities to check attendance. The material is really interesting, but Dr. Lenz seems closed off and sometimes rude when answering questions, and her test questions are worded in confusing ways(and she's not good at clarifying these). Still a doable class."
3,1.0,4.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,Terrible professor even though I got an A. I literally had a terrible time in this class. She can never admit when her questions are worded badly. The class literally just talks about rats for 16 weeks. If you like that then the class is for you. If not I would recommend another course. I did not learn anything from this instructor.
4,4.0,3.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"Lenz is so lovely and approachable. The class wasn't difficult, but there's lots of lectures to keep up with which can be tedious. If you slack off and don't watch them when posted, it will be tedious and a pain watching them all to catch up. Take good notes on everything since quiz/exam questions are picky. Just be organized and you'll be fine."
5,5.0,2.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"Good prof, tough course. Mostly graded off of exams and quizzes. Exams were always very difficult. Just watching the lecture won't help- definitely have to really understand the material for yourself in order to get an A on exams. She's an interesting person to listen to and her lectures were pretty enjoyable."
6,5.0,3.0, PSYCH4644,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"Dr. Lenz has made taking online classes because of covid so much more manageable. She consistently went out of her way to make the material as accessible and understandable as possible. While some of the topics may have been slightly difficult, her explanations made it very easy to digest. She was amazing for both 4644 and 3313."
7,5.0,3.0, PSYCH5604,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"The people saying that this class was bad obviously did not know what they were getting into, and that is not Dr. Lenz's fault. It's a 5000 lvl psych course, which at OSU, generally means group projects/presenting. Should have looked into it before you signed up. Anyway, Dr. Lenz is fantastic & wants you to succeed. Do the work and you'll do great."
8,2.0,4.0, PSYCH5604,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"I think Dr. Lenz would be a great 3313 prof, but this class was the worst neuro I have ever taken. Every class is people giving presentations, so it is so boring and really hard to follow. The open note exams are really stressful over all the papers. For homework, you have to write discussion posts and attend every class."
9,3.0,2.0, PSYCH5604,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"This class is based on essay exams, a presentation of a paper, discussion posts (for every class), and attendance. It's a fair amount of work, but the exams are open note. No final. Lenz doesn't actually teach that much because it's student-led, but she's good whens he does. For an upper-level course, I think that the course has too strict policies"
10,3.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"Class is a lot of information, but the tests are pretty easy. Dr. Lenz comes off as rude sometimes in class. She puts out crazy long exam reviews that you can fill out for practice, yet still puts questions on the exams that werent on the review, which can be annoying. The class has good EC and a midterm can be dropped, which is nice."
11,3.0,4.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"Dr. Lenz wasn't too bad. I really loved the course content so it was easier for me to prepare for tests. The class is VERY test heavy, but you can drop 1 of 3 midterms. There is also extra credit that will boost your grade. She is kind of rude sometimes, and she can be a bit snappy, so be prepared for that. Overall, not too bad, though."
12,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,amazing prof!! really clear and understandable lectures and she is always willing to make time to meet with any student if they need help outside of her office hours! makes great study guides for exams and wants her students to succeed. definitely recommend this class
13,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"Dr. Lenz is very passionate about what she teaches which makes lectures bearable. She also gives study guides for the exams which most other professors in the neuro department don't. You can drop 1 out of the 3 midterm grades, but you have to take the final. She offers 10 points of extra credit which really boost your grade. I would recommend!"
14,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"A good prof and clearly very passionate about the subject. You're graded on 3 midterms and a final, you can drop one of the midterms but you have to take the final. She also gives a study guide for exams which other Neuro profs don't. Definitely recommend"
15,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"Dr. Lenz has been my fav prof. so far. She is truly passionate about the material and very accessible if you cant make her office hrs which are directly after class. Exams arent bad if you study and use her detailed study guides for ea one. She is clear and gets to the point in lecture, moves fast so look at slides ahead. 110% reccomend her!"
16,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,Dr. Lenz is a great prof! She is very straight forward and provides detailed study guides. Her lectures provide just the right amount of material needed to succeed on tests. Textbook reading is optional. In-class activities once a week for attendance. Very friendly and approachable! Also allows you to drop a test which is very helpful.
17,4.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"Attendance is taken by weekly in class quizzes. There is essentially no homework. You take 3 exams and drop 1 but there is no curve or extra credit. She posts finished powerpoints on Carmen and makes great study guides. Moves quickly through lectures, but there is a lot of material to cover so its understandable."
18,5.0,3.0, PSYCH3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"Favorite class taken at OSU. She cared about students ands always available when help was needed. She lets you drop 1 out of 3 tests and the final is very straight forward. The entire class is very strait forward and although there is a lot of info, Dr. Lenz is passionate about it. She is the best professor to take this class with."
19,5.0,2.0, PSYCH5898,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,"Dr. Lenz was a great teacher.  Class was mostly article presentations by students.  Tests were essays over faculty lectures and all open note.  No final (just a third midterm).  Learned a TON, really enjoyed it, easy A."
20,5.0,3.0, NEURO3313,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,KATHRYN,LENZ,Everything on the test is in the notes.  Every time.
