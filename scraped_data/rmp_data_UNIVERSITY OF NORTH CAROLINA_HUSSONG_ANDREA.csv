1,5.0,2.0, PSYC471,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANDREA,HUSSONG,"Dr. Hussong is one of the most genuine professors at this university. She provides a level of flexibility for her students that shows she really cares about what is going on outside of class. Most assignments are easy, the lectures are repeating the textbook chapter so just read at some point. Exams were a bit hard so be sure to do the study guides"
2,5.0,4.0, PSYC395,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ANDREA,HUSSONG,"I absolutely adore her. She's wickedly smart, loves her work, and is dedicated to making sure her students understand the ""why"" rather than the ""what"" of psychological research."
