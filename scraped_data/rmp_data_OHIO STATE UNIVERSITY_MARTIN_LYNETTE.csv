1,5.0,1.0, SOC3487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"I loved dr. Martin & her class, but the grading rubrics could be confusing. attendance is worth 20/200 points, I usually didn't go to class even though it was mandatory, but still got a 100. There is a big project due at the end of the semester, but you work on it the whole semester so its basically done at the end. Exams are really easy too!"
2,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL3487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"She is great! She lets you miss 6 lectures a semester, the TAs and very responsive and approachable, and her exams are very straightforward. If you come to the lecture and pay attention, you'll get an A."
3,1.0,3.0, SOC2210,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"This course was VERY disorganized. Clearly, Lynette cares about teaching, but the Carmen page was impossible to navigate. Even as someone who normally adapts well to adverse learning environments, I thought it was challenging just because of the lack of guidance/no clear expectations given to us. I would not recommend this class."
4,1.0,2.0, SOC488,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"Easy class. Except huge catch. If you have any traumatic event happen in your life that prevents you from participating as much or asking for an extension, expect zero sympathy and an extremely insensitive response. Just tell student advocacy instead to avoid this issue."
5,3.0,1.0, SOC4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,Very easy class.  She was a good lecturer however could get very off-topic fast.
6,5.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,Super easy class and Dr. Martin shows that she cares about her students
7,5.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"Best professor. Chapter quizzes through Pearson (I finished all of mine in one day), 3 exams (all easy As), 10 discussion posts (easy), 1 final paper, 1 bonus paper, and bonus points on each exam. Really great class, you can work ahead, and will pass with an A. Genuine feedback and I highly recommend. I took it SU21, asynchronous and online."
8,2.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"This class was a joke. She sent out maybe a total of 3 announcements all semester of what we were supposed to be doing, uploaded only 1 lecture powerpoint, and left all the learning to us through a textbook. It was easy but definitely felt like a waste, and I was frustrated with the lack of communication. Readings, textbook quizzes, and one paper."
9,5.0,1.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"I took the four week class, and there was work due every day. It was incredibly interesting and there were lots of opportunities for extra credit. I would absolutely take this professor again!"
10,5.0,1.0, SOCIOL4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"Professor Martin is one of my all-time favorite professors. She's very knowledgeable, understanding, and inclusive to all students. If material ever gets too heavy or triggering, she's totally cool about letting you sit out of the lecture. She's very easy to talk to, and she grades fairly as well. Study guides make the exams pretty easy too."
11,5.0,2.0, SOC4610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"Lynette is great, she makes the class material fun and tells you exactly what you will need to do in order to do well in the class. You have to go to lectures since the notes are not filled out online and she takes attendance, but they are a great time and even more fun if you participate."
12,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL3487,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"Honestly love Lynette and want to take her again. You do a cool research project all semester and they walk you through it step by step by writing a series of papers. You have to show up to lecture to do well, but her exams were easy and she drops the lowest one. She makes the topic a lot more interesting!"
13,3.0,3.0, SOC4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,You have to show up or you lose points after 2 absences and the notes aren't filled out online. The exams aren't hard as long as you go to class. She seemed really passionate but also came across as condescending when students didn't give the exact wording she wanted. I would take her class again and give her a solid 7/10
14,5.0,3.0, SOC4610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"I find Lynette to be an incredible teacher with a thorough understanding of the world around her. She acts 'human' which goes a long way when it comes to learning the material in class. A little disorganized sometimes, but she makes up for it with stimulating lectures and the promotion of open discussions between classmates."
15,5.0,1.0, SOC4610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"I took Lynette for 4508 and 4610, and she's definitely my favorite professor in the sociology department. The material is relatively easy but stimulating, she lays out everything for the semester in the syllabus, exams are fine as long as you study a bit and pay attention. Final projects in both classes were easy. Wonderful human, please take her."
16,1.0,2.0, SOC4610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,Not very intellectually stimulating. She reads off the power point and is boring. Shes awkward to talk to and makes stupid banter in class. I recommend the class for easy GPA boost but only if you can stand to feel like you wasted an hour and twenty minutes of your life every class for material you could teach to yourself in half the time.
17,5.0,3.0, SOC4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"Dr. Martin is a great professor. I took both her 4610 and 4508 during the same semester which was great because they tend to overlap one another. Her class is easy if you show up and take good notes. If you don't show up, it's likely you won't do well on the exams. Both classes are super interesting and she teaches them well, I highly recommend."
18,5.0,2.0, SOC4610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"Dr. Martin is one of the best professors I've had at OSU. Her 4610 class is graded by three exams (1 dropped) and a large final project. She's fairly easy on her grading and the exams aren't bad if you show up to class (she does take attendance). Outside of class, she is extremely approachable and funny. Highly recommend her to anybody!"
19,5.0,2.0, SOC4610,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"I highly recommend her! I took three classes (Sociology 2330, 4508, and 4610) with her and she is an amazing professor. She cares about her students and her classes are very interesting."
20,5.0,2.0, SOC4508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LYNETTE,MARTIN,"Lynette is amazing! Her classes are interesting, applicable and easy to follow. Her teaching style is great and she really cares about her students understanding the topic and stretching their minds. I took her again the semester after I had her for a class and would take her again every semester if I could. Take a class with her!!"
