1,4.0,3.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,I think grade is dependent on TA. Mine was very good. Spinner-Halev is a great lecturer and I enjoyed the class.
2,4.0,5.0, PWAD272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,It was difficult to maintain a good grade in this course because we were only graded by a few things. His TAs are such harsh graders. It is hard to pay attention in his lectures because sometimes the material was just really boring. I do have to say he is such a kind person though. 
3,4.0,3.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"This is one of those classes where you get out what you put in; if you don't pay attention/care, it's gonna suck, but if you care and try it's going to be a great class, and it was. JHS is a great professor who is funny, knowledgeable and genuinely cares about his students. The course material is actually pretty fascinating and easy to grasp "
4,2.0,5.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,Very heavy and difficult. TA were to no help
5,1.0,5.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"Just do yourself a favor and run. If you don't have to take his class just don't. He made me rethink my entire major. The class is unnecessarily hard, hard to understand, messy powerpoints and its incredibly hard to follow along. TAs also have very rough and not cohesive grading scales and will explain things to you differently than SH. "
6,3.0,4.0, PWAD272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"The class if fine if you are taking it as a PWAD requirement, but I wouldn't take it with other reading heavy classes and I wouldn't recommend overall. Personally, I almost never do the readings for my classes but found that I had to take detailed notes on SH's readings in order to succeed on the exams. The papers are graded by TA so that depends. "
7,1.0,5.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"Exams were all multiple choice and extremely difficult - you could pretty much argue that every single answer was correct. You had to attend the lectures and pay attention to everything he said; attendance quizzes were given and he purposely made the answers ""wrong"" to figure out who wasn't attending class and taking the quizzes elsewhere. Avoid!"
8,3.0,3.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"This class was honestly not terrible but it just felt unorganized. The TAs were difficult graders and the midterms were extraordinarily specific. A lot of reading as well. I think you can do okay in the class but it is a good bit of work so if you can avoid taking this class, I would."
9,4.0,2.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"Comments definitely exaggerated. Decent professor who is incredibly flexible. Made the final open note, curved most of the exams, removed questions he thought were too hard. Honestly don't have to study too hard either as long as you do the readings, take notes in class. Some questions were worded weird and essays were graded hard, but still easy."
10,1.0,4.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"Jeff is the worst professor I have taken as a senior at UNC. Disorganized, uninteresting lectures. Insane amount of reading for a 200 level class. Exams are multiple choice (in a philo class?) and confusing. Does not seem to care about his students at all. TAs grading papers is always iffy but there were no clear guidelines in this class. "
11,2.0,5.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"Don't take this class!!!! Yes, attendance quizzes aren't bad, but exams are poorly written and are confusing to take. You read a book by Walzer on top of 20+ other philosophers papers and try to connect them, and Spinner does not help at all. Overall, its around 40+ pages of reading per class so beware. Papers were graded insanely harshly too."
12,4.0,3.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"The only issue I had with this class is that it was my introduction to philosophical writing. Some test questions can be application based, but are not difficult as long as you make an attempt to understand the readings. He lowered the weight of our worst test and made the final open note. Don't get the hate for Jeff, just understand this is UNC.
"
13,2.0,5.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"Very interesting topics covered in class, but a lot of the content covered on exams were upright confusing. A lot of the questions seemed to be there to confuse you and leave you very unsure. Grading (TAs), especially for papers, was often very harsh and it was also hard to know what was required of you. Interesting class, would not take again. "
14,1.0,5.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,His lectures are very disorganized. He talks fast and has very little information on his slides. He gives difficult multiple choice exams that were tricky but I feel like short answer would be better to truly show mastery over the material and not trick us. But when we asked him about doing that he said that would be too much for the TAs to grade. 
15,2.0,5.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"The lectures are not organized. The readings are confusing, and the exams are even worse (vague questions with no clear answers). I attended every lecture (because of his attendance quizzes) and read every reading, but, even with studying days prior, these exams are very difficult and not made for students to get an A. Good luck taking this class. "
16,5.0,1.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,I dont know why people are leaving bad reviews. This class is super easy all you have to do is take notes during lecture and you're fine. the final was literally open note and open book. super interesting material too
17,4.0,2.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"The other reviews are exaggerated. Quiz and exam questions are clear and direct. You just need to understand and re-read the readings at least once to get an A. His lectures only have a loose progression, so write down everything he says and organize it on your own time. TAs grade the essays harshly, so bring your outline to office hours. "
18,2.0,5.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,The content is interesting and Spinner is a good professor but his grading doesn't make any sense. It feels like TAs just give random grades with little feedback. And the exam questions are meant to trick you. You have to be in class. You don't get out what you put in. 
19,1.0,3.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,"His lectures are mostly just repeating what the readings said. He values a traditional classroom experience over accessibility and the health of the students. The exams were multiple choice (in a philosophy class?), and they're made to trick you. The first two just expected you to memorize the readings. Don't take this class."
20,2.0,5.0, POLI272,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEFF,SPINNER-HALEV,No grading criteria. Everything was vague and exam questions were made to confuse you. We had so much reading a week and all of it was contradictory. The lectures were boring and also did nothing to help clarify readings. Grades were very subjective and overall the course was stressful. If you are a poli sci major taking this for credit... AVOID!!!
