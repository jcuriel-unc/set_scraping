1,4.0,3.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"Jenkins is a nice person and lecturer; you could tell he was passionate about his work. However, this did lead to him going off on tangents sometimes. Class was easy and we had very few graded work but he did not give us our grades. I only knew that I ended up with an A. "
2,4.0,1.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"Jenkins is a nice guy and has a great personality. The class wasnt hard, he assigned long readings for class but if you skimmed them you were totally fine as he never gave any tests or quizzes. We watched documentaries and wrote short reaction papers for our grades. However, we never actually got grades back on them but I still ended up with an A."
3,3.0,1.0, POLI89,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"Professor Jenkins is a good professor. However, he never graded any of our many reaction papers except our first one from the beginning of the semester. Due to this, I never knew what grade I had, in fact, for our final project I never got my grade back. "
4,4.0,4.0, POLI260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,Jenkins is a great person and willing to help a lot outside of class and very quick to respond to emails. Class was very information-dense and quizzes were tough. You can get away without reading the textbook as long as you study his lecture notes and go to class. Not my favorite class content-wise but great professor!
5,4.0,2.0, PWAD260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,Jenkins is a pretty good professor and all-around was understanding and accommodating this semester. I didn't do the readings but if you pay attention in class you will be fine. Did not receive much feedback for assignments but he was an easy grader and moved our final online. I enjoyed this class and would definitely take another with Jenkins!
6,2.0,4.0, POLI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"He is nice and if you go to office hours he will help you. But, he is an incredibly hard grader and his tests are very difficult too. His lectures are also the most boring lectures that I have ever attended, so I could not understand the course material. His class also has very little structure and he gives study guides almost the night before."
7,2.0,4.0, POLI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,Basically reads from the textbook the entire class. Takes attendance every day. Words questions for quizzes and tests poorly. Confusing with directions. Boring but nice (but he has to be right)
8,2.0,3.0, POLI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"Professor Jenkins is a really nice guy. It's not impossible to get a good grade, its just the most boring and draining class I have ever taken at UNC. He lectures at monotone for the entire period and reads off of a word document. The class is not about thinking critically about international organizations its about memorizing basic facts & dates."
9,3.0,4.0, POLI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"Professor Jenkins is a super nice guy and someone I think would be fun to talk to over coffee, but his lectures were incredibly boring. Especially online, it's important to make the material engaging and he hasn't done that so far. However, he's super knowledgeable and a great resource if you're interested in international politics."
10,3.0,3.0, POLI260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"The topic of the class wasn't interesting to me, but Prof Jenkins was really passionate about the material so it made it bearable. He expects you to participate every day, so speak up or your participation grade will take a hit. There were small quizzes every few weeks and then a final. As well as an easy group project. I never did the readings btw"
11,3.0,4.0, POLI260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,Overall a nice guy but very judgemental if you don't immediately understand the material. Does not give off nice vibes. Very uppity. He likes to assert his knowledge on a topic even when its not needed.
12,5.0,4.0, POL451,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"Dr. Jenkins is not only one of the best professors at Carolina, he is one of the best people. Dr. J has a treasure trove of knowledge if you are willing to attend lectures and listen. Always accessible and a fair grader who will give you good feedback/make clear expectations. I implore you to take a class with Dr. J, especially if you're into EE."
13,4.0,3.0, POLI260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"The most knowledgeable professors I've ever had. The class sometimes is a little dense but very informative. Grades are from participation, take home midterm, 5 quizzes and a group presentation that isn't too bad. The only thing I didn't like is he takes forever to grade midterms, we didn't get ours back until the day before the final."
14,5.0,4.0, POLI469,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,Love Jenkins. Highly recommend his class.
15,4.0,4.0, POLI260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"Solid lecturer, but very slow grader. Would take another of his classes."
16,5.0,4.0, POLI469,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"Dr. Jenkins's level of knowledge is crazy intimidating, but he manages to balance that out by being incredibly accessible and relatable to his students. More reading than I've ever had in my life and a couple of long papers, but he gives incredibly detailed feedback and is always available for help. You'll come out with super detailed knowledge"
17,4.0,4.0, POLI260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"Very, very, knowledgeable about Eastern Europe (as expected). Definitely would not hurt to have some background knowledge as Prof. Jenkins can skip around and reference all kinds of events. Although the class is dense and requires a lot ( A LOT) of reading, Prof. Jenkins' knowledge will make sure you learn much about this area and its politics."
18,5.0,4.0, POLI260,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"This class was super lecture heavy but super interesting. Jenkins knows an incredible amount of information about Eastern Europe. There's lots of reading in the class, so be aware of that."
19,5.0,3.0, POLI469,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"I also had Professor Jenkins for POLI 260, and he's definitely one of the best teachers I've had so far at this school! He cares a lot about helping his students succeed and will give you lots of helpful feedback if you ask. Attendance does matter and there's usually a lot of reading every week, but if you show effort he'll grade you accordingly."
20,5.0,3.0, POLI459,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,ROBERT,JENKINS,"He knows a ridiculous amount of information about transatlantic security, but he manages to make this information much easier to understand. There are probably seventy pages of reading per night, but it is mostly interesting stuff. Participation in class is a must; there are no exams, but there are a lot of writing assignments. "
