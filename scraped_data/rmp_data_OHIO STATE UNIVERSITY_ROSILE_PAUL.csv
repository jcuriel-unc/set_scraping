2,5.0,2.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,ROSILE,"This class takes effort. Attendance is important and its a lot of work. But, Dr. Rosile puts in the effort to make the class interesting. He is passionate about the subject and cares that his students are experiencing this passion too. He encouraged my interests and helped me explore EHS careers. put in the effort and you'll be fine"
3,1.0,1.0, PUBEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,ROSILE,"After experiencing both Covid and depression and receiving a doctors note for both of these issues, Dr.Rosile would not unlock the current modules so that I could catch up and stay current in the course. Instead he forced me to continue doing them in order, even though each module is unrelated to the others. Doesn't seem to care about the students."
4,2.0,1.0, PUBHEHS4327,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,ROSILE,"This was a course more about finding scientific resources and interpreting at scientific information than it was about climate change and human health (the title of the course). It felt fairly disorganized, with difficult to interpret instructions for homework and a heavy load of busy work."
5,3.0,2.0, PUBEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,ROSILE,This class is easy and there are no exams or quizzes. You basically work on a semester long project with your group every week. There are homework assignments and journals. The assignments are very easy they both took me no longer than an hour at best. Everyone ends up with an A. I ended with a 99% A.
6,2.0,1.0, PUBHLTH3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,ROSILE,"This class at its roots is easy. There are no exams and your grade is based mainly around a semester-long group video project. The topics are interesting and Dr. Rosile is very passionate about his field. However, the class is not organized well and is heavy in ""busy work""."
7,2.0,1.0, PUBHEHS3310,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,PAUL,ROSILE,"Dr. Rosile is scrambled most of the time and the entire class is busy work and one meaningless group project. It is extremely easy, just follow the rubric and turn in assignments. Each week there is a reflection, homework, learning activity, and group project stuff due. It's not a lot I swear, it's super easy no exams. Turn stuff in and participate"
