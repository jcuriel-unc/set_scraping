1,2.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"The class was fine and uninteresting but not very hard if you read the textbook. Going to class was completely useless as he just repeats parts of the textbook you already read, but he takes attendance through quizzes. My TA was fantastic though and graded papers fairly. I just wish class time was more productive as I taught myself everything. "
2,2.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,I was disappointed in this class because I was so excited to take it and knew it was going to be an easy A. Roberts was very all over the place during his lectures and got distracted most of the time. Most of the info on the exams was not talked about or just briefly skimmed over in the lecture. There's no way I should get a B- in a 100 level
3,2.0,1.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"Class is incredibly easy if you review the lecture slides and skim the textbook. The biggest issue would be the professor. Dr. Roberts, at times, had this aura of ""I'm better than you"" during his lectures. He would also use most of the class to just answer questions, without getting to the content. Overall, take it if you need an easy A."
4,2.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"This class is very lecture heavy so please please please pay attention during his lecture. Hie class his weighted on 3 exams, 2 papers, and participation in his class. READ THE TEXTBOOK! The most beneficial thing to do in his class is to read the textbook. "
5,2.0,4.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"This class was based on 3 tests, which was unfair and not based on what we learned what so ever. He isn't a bad lecturer but they were not helpful. Would not recommend unless you want have to. "
6,3.0,4.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"Professor Roberts is very easy to listen to and led very interesting lectures. However, his class is oriented around 3 exams and 2 papers. The exams are pretty tough, with a lot of trick questions. You have to read the textbook thoroughly and keep up with the lectures completely. The papers are slight. He does not curve exams."
7,1.0,4.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"Tests are hard for no reason. The second test (out of 3) had a 68 average. There are extra credit opportunities (to which I personally went to almost all of them) but not enough to come back from how bad the tests are. Normally an interesting lecture, but would not recommend."
8,1.0,4.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"For a 100-level class, this class is unnecessarily hard. The tests are hard to pass because it is based on the lecture slides and he words the exams so tricky. The average test scores were 70s and he does not curve them. Essays are easy but the exams will bring your grade down.
Definitely do not recommend."
9,3.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"Prof Roberts is very knowledgable, fair, and organized. He's not very flexible or accomodating, but the class is not too hard and the workload is reasonable. Totally fine professor and interesting class. Do the readings and you will be fine."
10,4.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"Class only consisted of three tests including final, two paper, recitation, and poll ev (had so many issues with poll ev technology).  Pretty chill class and getting a good grade is possible.  Keep up with readings and definitely study lecture slides for test.  Try to get Michael Greenberger for your TA; fair grader for papers."
11,4.0,2.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"roberts was very nice and a good professor, but he did pollev for attendance. the papers were graded easily, but the tests revolved around the lectures and sometimes included irrelevant and hard-to-remember information. for a 100 level class, however, it was easy and relatively laid back."
12,3.0,4.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"Overall, I enjoyed professor Roberts' course. The class grade revolves solely around tests and papers but the more you studied and listened to lectures, the better off you'll be. I would recommend him as he is clearly knowledgeable and engaged in politics, making it easier to not get bored."
13,3.0,4.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"Roberts had fairly interesting lectures, but the entire course is 3 tests and 2 papers, with participation taken through PollEv. Tests were extremely difficult and had many trick questions. Averages were in the 70s for all exams and he does not curve. TA's grade the papers, 3 and 7 pages in length. "
14,2.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"Even if you knew all the material, the tests had badly worded questions. He didn't curve the exams even tho our 2nd exam average was low. Pollev was used for attendance but he used it halfway through the semester and many people had problems with it including me. He did not listen to problems and would not curve anything. Would not recommend."
15,3.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"Professor Roberts graded participation through Poll Everywhere, with accuracy counting towards full participation credit. The class consists of lectures, with a few in person multiple choice tests that most people will need to study for. There are two papers for the class that are not very research heavy and not very difficult."
16,3.0,4.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"While I really enjoyed Professor Roberts's lectures, his exams are unfair. Specifically, I would do all of the readings and feel as if I had a great grasp on the material, and then receive a 70 on the exams. You are basically graded off of two papers and 3 exams. If it wasn't for his trick questions on tests, I would be giving him 5/5 stars. "
17,4.0,3.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"Professor Roberts is very accomplished and intellectual in his field making him a good lecturer and easy to listen to. Readings are assigned but don't stress over them, they are there mainly for context. Grade is based on two papers and two exams so beware. Class was not stressful as long as you put forth effort. Would take again."
18,3.0,4.0, POLI100,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"Professor Roberts is extremely smart and intellectual about Political Science, so lectures are not boring. Only bad thing about the class is that you are graded on only 4 things, 2 papers and 2 exams."
19,5.0,3.0, POLI384,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"He taught with another professor for 384, so it's hard to distinguish who graded what, etc. However, his lectures were interesting considering the content. And to respond to the reviews that said he was rude, I don't think he is whatsoever. Solid professor."
20,4.0,3.0, POLI100H,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JASON,ROBERTS,"I enjoyed this class for it being my first POLI SCI course at UNC. The lectures were long but Professor Roberts did try to gauge discussion throughout the classroom. The readings were very important and were applicable to discussions. Paper was long but attainable, final exam was a little off putting but relevant to current events and class topics."
