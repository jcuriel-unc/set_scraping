1,2.0,3.0, SOCI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,"It's clear that Professor Cai cares about his students and is very knowledgeable about research. However, he has difficulty explaining the concepts in a way for students to understand. His lectures confused me more than I was. The textbook is more of a workbook and explains no concepts. Be ready to teach yourself. No clear rubrics for anything. "
2,3.0,3.0, SOCI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,"Professor Cai isn't the best lecturer but as long as you read the book and teach the majority of the information to yourself you will be fine. Grades consisted of weekly Homework and Labs, occasional quizzes, and three exams. Difficult questions unless you study. Not an impossible course, learn R as well. "
3,2.0,3.0, SOCI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,Stat was really hard and confusing. Nothing was that hard just confusing and weird. Prof Cai has a thick accent so if that is distracting for you I wouldn't recommend because lectures are so helpful in understanding the content. Midterm and final were hard. 
4,1.0,3.0, SOCI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,"Professor Cai is incredibly out of touch with his students. He lectures all class long (boring lectures) and does not interact with us, and then gives us exams that over half the class fails because they are way too long and test us on content most of us don't understand. Pretty sure he doesn't know any of our names. Not sure how I will pass..."
5,3.0,3.0, SOCI121,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,"Dr. Cai is a very sweet man and very interested in his field. However I expected this class to be more policy based- it is a straight demography class (migration, mortality, fertility based). Unless you are specifically interested in the topic I would avoid as it was very hard for me to get interested. He is accessible and was not hard to pass"
6,4.0,3.0, SOCI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,Professor Cai was very easy to get ahold of by email or in office hours if you need extra help. There was sometimes a communication gap but overall there werent many assignments and pretty easy to get a good grade as long as you put in a little effort.
7,2.0,3.0, SOCI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,He's very disorganized as a professor and it's difficult to follow along. Honestly didn't learn much and idk how I passed. His TA is very helpful tho
8,4.0,2.0, SOCI121,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,"This class is easy but lectures can be pretty boring. If you read the textbook your solid. There were ""pop quizzes"" that you can take unlimited times and he was very clear about what will be on the midterm. Not the most interesting topic but he's really into it and there's very little work to do for this class."
9,3.0,2.0, SOCI121,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,"He is a nice guy and the class is easy, but his lectures are incredibly boring, long, and scattered. He was not clear on grades and took a long time to grade/ wouldn't post scores and did not follow syllabus. Occasional pop quiz on reading. He will tell you what's on the test and it isn't challenging. Interesting topic that could be taught better."
10,1.0,4.0, SOCI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,"Honestly, I don't see how I'll make it through the semester. The class is so disorganized and the textbook being used is so vague and misleading. At this point, I'll be happy to pass the class just enough to get the credit for the major. The quizzes are no-sense and I feel like I'm learning nothing at all."
11,1.0,4.0, SOCI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,Hard to understand. Unclear and confusing in explanations. Makes things harder and more confusing than necessary.
12,4.0,3.0, SOCI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,The content of this class was pretty difficult but Professor Cai really cares about his students and want everyone to do well. Him and his TA were also both easily accessible outside of class. If you make sure you truly understand the homework assignments then you should be fine on the exams.
13,1.0,3.0, SOCI121,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,Every week there's an online quiz you have to take and you're supposed to use the textbook but there are unlimited attempts to the quiz and he said you could guess and keep re-doing it until you get a 100. Buying the textbook is a waste of money. For the tests just review the powerpoints and do the study guide. There's a final group paper
14,4.0,1.0, SOCI121,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,Professor Yong is very sweet but the class is just very uninteresting and his lectures tended to ramble. But the class was very easy since you could retake online quizzes unlimited times and he tended to tell you exactly what would be on the midterm and final. So most of the time you don't really need to pay much attention.
15,5.0,2.0, SOCI121,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,"Prof. Yong Cai's class was one the of the best at UNC. After readings some of the reviews about the thick accent I hesitated to take the course, but I'm so glad I eventually did. I had no issue understanding lectures. He's one of the sweetest persons at UNC, but also it's an EASY A if you are willing to show up to class and read the book."
16,5.0,2.0, SOCI121,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,"Professor Cai was the sweetest professor I've had at UNC. He has a thick accent, which makes it hard to follow his lectures, but have no fear: he posts his lecture powerpoints on Sakai & he lays out very clear study guides for both the midterm &final, if you study with the guides and his powerpoints- you can make an easy A. He's also super friendly"
17,1.0,1.0, SOCI121,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,"He's not a very good lecturer, which, combined with his very heavy accent, made it nearly impossible to follow along with the lectures. He told us EXACTLY what would be on the midterm, and the final wasn't bad. Easy to get an A if you're willing to put the work in, but don't take it because you think it may be interesting. He's nice & fair though."
18,2.0,1.0, SOCI121,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,Prof Cai is nice but isn't very supportive during class. Class  seemed to drag on even when the material was interesting. The homework isn't difficult but attention to detail is very important. The TA was more accessible than Cai. Overall the class wasn't too hard- just study the powerpoints (posted online) and the books readings.
19,2.0,2.0, SOCI252,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,"Professor Cai is really nice, but struggles with his English and explaining concepts. I got an A, but I felt confused 99% of the time."
20,2.5,3.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,YONG,CAI,Professor Cai is skilled when discussing or using data analysis software. What he could stand to improve from is articulating concepts and relating them back to the class example. There were lots of times someone asked a question and he would answer in a detailed and unspecific way you wouldn't remember what the original question was. Read the book
