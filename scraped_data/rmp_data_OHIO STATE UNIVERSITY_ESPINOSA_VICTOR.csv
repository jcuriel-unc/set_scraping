1,5.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,Mr. Espinosa is one of the best professors I have had! This class is really an easy A if you try. Sometimes his grading is a little tough but he gives you PLENTY of opportunities to make up for any points you might have lost. He will literally give you the answer if you meet with him and he's a great guy in general who really wants you to pass.
2,1.0,5.0, SOC3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"Wow where do I start, took an online race in America class, the work is absolutely ridiculous for it being a 3000 level class. Its way tooo much reading he nitpicks everything on each of your assignments, if you dont add a word count on your assignments which are 6 total due every Wednesday and Friday you will lose all points. RUN RUN RUN AWAY"
3,4.0,2.0, SOCIOL3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"It was a pretty standard sociology class. He did a good job and really tried to get the class to debate the readings. (He did a pretty good job considering our class was at 8:00am). I wasn't all that interested in the class because it was just a gen ed, but other classmates got more into it. He has a very strict no phone/technology policy."
4,5.0,2.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"You get as much out of this class as you get in. Most of the in-class lectures are discussions, and Victor loves letting the students share their opinions on the topics being discussed in class. He's always available for his office hours, and will talk to you even if you don't have any specific questions."
5,4.0,1.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"This class is an actual joke in terms of difficulty. Victor himself isn't a native English speaker so he pretty much gives everyone 100% on all assignments as long as they are turned in. While his lectures are fairly interesting and intuitive, the homework for this class is high school level. Enroll in this class for an easy break."
6,3.0,1.0, SOC2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"While Victor is a very nice man and a great professor to just talk to, his class really didn't add anything to my academic experience. He never really had a clear lesson plan and the purpose of the whole course seemed to just be one big workshop for the final paper. Basically everything was graded for completeness, an easy A, but a fun class"
7,1.0,3.0, SOC3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"He can be pretty crass when leaving feedback on your assignments, especially essays. In my opinion, he lets his leftist bias show while teaching the class. For example, he asked us to asses where racial tension was in the U.S, but when he graded it he acted like there was only one right answer. There are many other examples of his leftist bias."
8,5.0,2.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"Engaging, informative lectures. Reading material, while often lengthy, is interesting. Requires a lot of writing. Overall excellent professor and I learned a lot from him."
9,5.0,1.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,Class had zero quizzes or tests. Had a reading with summary and opinion article due every week and two essays. Victor seems to be very smart and wants everyone to succeed. Class got boring at times but he recognizes that we have many more difficult classes.
10,5.0,3.0, SOCIOL1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,This was a great class! You watch documentaries that cover many social issues that are very interesting. His accent did frighten me at first because I have had difficulty understanding him during the first two lectures but I grew used to it and he uses his experiences coming from a Latin American family which helps relay the material.
11,5.0,2.0, SOCIOL3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"I took his online class and its the easiest A I've had so far at OSU. There was a lot of work, but he was a super lenient grader. The material was also really interesting. I would definitely take him again!"
12,5.0,2.0, SOC3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,This class was an easy A. There were weekly assignments (about 4-7 per week) and 2 essays. No tests. Just had to answer 1 review question and a summary on an article for homework and write in the discussion board w/ other students. It's some work but didn't take up all my summer time.
13,4.0,1.0, SOC2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"Real nice guy but theres a good amount of work in the class. Super easy grader though, I've gotten 100% on the weekly homework. He's very flexible and really listens to students about the assignments. He lets you turn things in late, and there's a ton of extra credit opportunities. Nice guy."
14,5.0,3.0, SOC2367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"Thought provoking and stimulating. Spoke w/ him outside of class & corresponded with him over email several times. Prof. Victor requires alot of work on behalf of the student.  If you assume equal responsibility for your education, everything you need to learn is provided. If you prefer, as many do, to be told precisely what to think, stay away."
15,2.0,3.0, SOC3380,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"Disorganized, making it very hard to track your performance. Non-communicative, making it a giant pain to resolve any issues. Prompts and instructions were contridictory. The subject matter was interesting, but he was so clearly dismissive about actually helping us that we all had to start an email group just to decipher the assignment prompts."
16,5.0,2.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"Great Professor. He genuinely cares about the class and the topics. You just have to read some online articles and write a page summary, one movie group project, and the 2 midterms (which were not hard). You can miss 4 classes but if you know you will miss more it will drop you 10% from your final grade automatically."
17,5.0,3.0, SOC3302,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"You'll be doing a lot of reading for the class, but the articles are pretty interesting. Presentations in class and discussions are interesting but can get pretty heated if a few people start arguing. He always wants to hear your opinion, which is pretty cool."
18,3.0,2.0, SOC1101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,English is not his first language; has an accent but you get used to it. good teacher. Youll read a lot (20 page essays per week andthen write summary). Attendance is basically mandatory although you are allowed to miss a few classes. Tests are easy essays. This class was one of my favorites. learned a lot. Heated debates! never used the textbook
19,2.5,2.0, 24508,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,VICTOR,ESPINOSA,"I think he genuinely wants his students to learn the material, but his lectures were confusing. Even though he is a non-native speaker, I feel like the language barrier was not the issue. He just had a really hard time teaching the material due to being very disorganized. We wrote lots of papers, and I don't think he really graded any of them. "
