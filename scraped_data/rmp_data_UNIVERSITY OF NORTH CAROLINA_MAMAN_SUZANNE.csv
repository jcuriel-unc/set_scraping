1,5.0,2.0, HBEH-520,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SUZANNE,MAMAN,Dr. Maman is a great lecturer! She makes broad topics easier to understand and also provides lots of outside resources to help her students succeed in her classes. She is also kind and understanding when it comes to due dates. A great choice as a professor for any health behavior/public health class!
