1,5.0,1.0, NSCI222,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SARA,ESTLE,"Amazing class. A lot of material, but an easy A if you stay on top of your material. Lots of feedback to work with though.

She's one of the best professors at UNC if you show sincerity and study hard as well. I know many people who passed with flying colors with no hassle. But some also managed to fail the class, so I guess you need to work a bit."
2,5.0,3.0, NSCI-225,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SARA,ESTLE,"One of the best professors I have had. I am even taking her for another class next semester. I learned so much in her class, but it wasn't the easiest class either. Put in hard work, and you will get an A. "
3,5.0,2.0, NSCI222,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SARA,ESTLE,She was one of the most amazing and caring professors I have had. Her class was not difficult as long as you either read the textbook or attend the lectures. She prepares you for the exams very well and makes the content interesting! Definitely take her if you have the chance.
4,5.0,3.0, NSCI-225,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SARA,ESTLE,She is so easy to talk to and very passionate about what she teaches. She gives group/partner assignments in class that are easy and fun. For each of your exams you have a multiple choice portion and take home writing portion which I think makes her grading very fair. There are weekly low-stakes quizzes which are great in preparation for her exams.
5,5.0,4.0, NSCI222,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SARA,ESTLE,"Ive been told shes a bit tougher than other profs for 222, but overall she was a great prof! You can tell she is super passionate abt the subject. Be prepared because the way she writes tests questions is confusing, but the structure of the class made this not such a big deal."
