1,1.0,4.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"She often didn't understand her own material. Unfortunately, she is currently the only professor for PSYCH 3321, which is a required course for B.S. students. My best advice would be to go to the TA's for help, as they probably have a better understanding."
2,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"Nothing against Van Zandt personally, she just doesn't have that firm of a grasp on how students can retain this information. I got through the class with a fine grade but a lot of stress and don't feel like I actually learned. The TA's are great, super helpful. She's very hard to reach outside of class, frustrating and hard to understand"
3,1.0,4.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"She made this class too difficult. The material itself isn't hard, but she finds a way to make it confusing. The notes she posts online are garbage(tbh theyre not great during lecture either) and there's a lot of miscommunication with her and the TAs. I am honestly shocked I did well in this class, but I don't think I actually learned much. Avoid!"
4,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3321H,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"I had Dr. Van Zandt for the honors version of 3321. The homework is written by the TA and isnt too bad if you actually understand the material, which can be hard because Van Zandt was not great at teaching it. It seemed like 80% of the class was lost. I took 3 stats classes prior to this one and I ended w/ an A, but struggled for it. Avoid her."
5,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"Honestly avoid if you can. Idk how she is with her other courses but she can't teach stats. 3321 doesn't need to be as difficult as she is making it. Doesn't post notes or communicate with TA. Had terms incorrectly defined on her Carmen which is gr8, students learning false info is the goal right? And shes the only one teaching it SP19! Yay OSU:)))"
6,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"Has a nice personality, but don't let that fool you. The concepts in this class aren't difficult & she somehow makes them impossible to understand. Written exams with no calculator & this is a STATS CLASS. Minimal time for exams, HW doesn't match w/what you're tested, & prof is hard to reach & not helpful. TAs are great, but only do HW not lectures"
7,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"She is so unorganized. Doesnt post the full notes &refuses to answer questions about the HW because shes not the one grading it. She was out of town for the 2 weeks before &of the second midterm so help was limited. The content you think you will be tested on from the HW, notes actice isnt even hard but she asks questions we have never discussed"
8,1.0,5.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"She skips through the notes super fast, & doesn't post the complete notes online so there's a good chance of missing things. Her exams don't test what we learn. Practice problems aren't even relevant for the test. Unable to use my cheat sheet for the exam b/c what's in the notes aren't on the test. It is unfortunate she is the only professor."
9,2.0,5.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"She explains things in the most complicated ways and Ive learned more from teaching myself. Her exams are not like anything done in class, on the homework, or on the exam review problems. Youre allowed a front and back cheat sheet for exams, but its useless when her exam problems are so difficult, poorly worded, and not multiple choice."
10,1.0,4.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"Professor is very unreasonable. She is hard to reach and if you can she tries to get you to go away as soon as possible. Exams are tricky and no one is allowed to ask questions. She provides review questions, but no answers because she found the questions online. Would recommend taking this with ANY other professor."
11,2.0,4.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"The exams are written (no multiple choice). The exams are approximately 20 questions long and we only had 55 minutes to complete. Wording on exams can be confusing. There are two textbooks: she pulls from both. Lectures either make you feel like you have a handle on topics, or you have no idea what is going on. She posts incomplete lecture slides."
12,2.0,3.0, PSYCH2301,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"Trisha Van Zandt seems like a fun person outside of class, but was not a great professor. The topics were unorganized and she never provided clear notes.  The only points come from quizzes and exams.  Talked about her political agenda all class. Very boring lectures.  Was excited for this class but very disappointed. Walked away learning nothing."
13,5.0,2.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,This is by far the best class I've taken at Ohio State so far. She is extremely helpful and very funny. I recommend office hours simply because her TAs and she give very helpful hints for the exams. I don't really enjoy the subject matter (this is just a required course) but she makes it interesting and fun to learn. Highly recommend.
14,4.5,3.0, PSYCH3321,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"4 exams. She allows an 8.5x11 page of notes for exams which is quite helpful. Posts notes online, but you need to go to lecture to understand them. She gives you review questions for exams which help alot. She also curves exams. One hw assignment every week dropped the lowest 4. ALEKS hw wasnt bad. Gives out extra credit for going to class. "
15,4.0,2.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,This class is honestly quite easy. Dr. Van-Zandt lets you bring a cheat sheet into the exam and she even gives you extra credit for showing up to class. The exams themselves are not really that bad either and she stresses on things in lecture that usually show up in class.
16,2.0,3.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"I really did not like her teaching style at all. Her exams were harder than they needed to be. I have taken a regular stats class and a calculus class and received an A in both of them, but got a B in this class. She doesn't explain well, and her TAs for my semester graded the exams REALLY hard. Not the worst prof I've had,  but avoid if you can"
17,3.0,4.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"I don't know if it's just the way she taught it, but I hardly understood any of the material for this class. However, I still got an A on every exam and in the class. That doesn't make sense, obviously, but I guess if you want a relatively easy A class, go ahead and take this one!"
18,2.5,1.0, PSYCH2220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"I didn't know what I was doing on the exams and I still got an A on all of them. It's an easy class, but she makes the information harder than it needs to be. If you want an easy stats class, take her."
19,3.0,2.0, PSYCH2303,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"Trisha is a wonderful person, but she is not the best professor. She covered the topics adequately, but her lectures were out of date and often centered around Dateline or 60 Minutes videos from the 80s and 90s. Her exams are very easy if you go to class, and she provides the quiz questions in advance so you can prepare."
20,4.0,3.0, PSYCH2301,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,TRISH,VAN ZANDT,"Easy class IF you go to lecture. The only grades are the midterms and two in class essays, though. There's a lot of extra credit, but you really have to work for it."
