1,5.0,3.0, BUSMHR7244,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","Dr Lount is a masterful professor.  I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures, his teaching methodologies,  and his efforts to help students even beyond what was required in the classroom.  I would take him again for another subject in a heart-beat.  His lectures were always interesting, and his in class negotiations gave a lot of practical experience."
2,5.0,1.0, BUSMHR3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","Professor Lount is really good teacher in fisher. His class is, compared to other classes, interesting.  The exam is not easy, you have to read the text book.  Highly recommend to take his class."
3,4.5,3.0, MHR3200,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","If you are a bad test taker, this class can be challenging, since only 3 midterms will make up your grade.. no homework, quizzes etc. Prof. Lount loves his job and it shows in lecture"
4,4.5,2.0, MHR701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","Professor Lount√¢??s lectures were very clear and almost entertaining.  He uses several film clips and movie excerpts to help demonstrate the topics.  There were several times the entire hall was laughing.  The exams were difficult but fair.  Overall, I would recommend him to anyone taking BUSMHR701. One of the better instructors at Fisher!"
5,5.0,3.0, HR701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","Fell asleep almost every class but he is very passionate about HR. Videos made it bearable and extra credit offered. Tests were specific, definitely need the book"
6,4.5,2.0, MHR701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","Professor Lount is solid. He's passionate about what he teaches. Class is a little boring, but he splices videos in every now and then to keep the content fresh. My only complaint is about some of the overly-specific test questions; if you don't read the book and pick up on minute details, it's easy to miss some of the ones he asks. Still got an A."
7,5.0,1.0, MHR701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","The class itself is pretty boring, but Professor Lount is a great teacher.  He's a very clear lecturer and provides his slides online.  There are three exams, non of which are cumulative.  The book helps clear things up, but isn't necessary to do well.  I would definitely recommend him for this class."
8,5.0,1.0, MHR701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR",He seems like a good guy but the material is just terribly boring. He comes off as a professor type but not snobby in the least bit. He reminds me of the UPS whiteboard guy for some reason.
9,4.5,2.0, MHR701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","Prof. Lount is a A+ instructor in Fisher. His lectures are extremely clear and very easy to follow. He knows how to promote himself and makes you trust him (He looks intelligent, confident, and professional). It's true that he usually doesn't make fun of himself; instead, he acts more like a gentleman from Europe. I feel like he's a mystery."
10,4.5,2.0, MHR701,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","I am not a Human Resources major, but I found this class to be very interesting.  Lecture isn't ""mandatory"" but he will give you information for the test that you can't find elsewhere. He makes it very clear what is expected of you. Read the book (very easy to read), go to class, study the slides and you will get an  A."
11,4.0,2.0, BUS400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","You absolutely are tested on the movies, but they are very easy questions and there are maybe 2 questions for each test.  The books helped a bit, just read the bold print. He does some ""grade adjusting"" for tests and gives out an easy extra credit assignment.  You are rewarded for sitting through this boring class as he gives hints to the tests."
12,4.0,4.0, BUS400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","Prof Lount himself is not a bad guy, but the class is painfully boring.  There are 3-4 in class assignments (surveys) that are given at random times.  That's the only reason to come to class - powerpoints are on carmen. All the videos you watch in class are fun but serve no other purpose b/c tests (3) have no questions about them."
13,3.0,4.0, BUS400,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ROBERT,"LOUNT, JR","I am not the kind of person to call classes boring, but BUS MHR 400 is the most boring class you can ever take.  Teachers at Fisher don't even try to make it more entertaining and don't realize that it's NOT a business major course. Still a mystery to me how the lecture that has 12 slides and one that has 30 slides can last exact same amount of tim"
