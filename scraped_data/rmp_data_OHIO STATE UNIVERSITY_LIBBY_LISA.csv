1,4.0,1.0, PSYCH2376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"Never read textbook or went to class. Lectures good, homework kind of busywork, but easy points. Interesting topics, easy tests, would take again."
2,2.0,4.0, PSYCH367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"Lisa seems like a lovely woman and had an upbeat personality. Always came to class positive but when it came to her quizzes (which made up most of the grade), they were impossible!!! I get that with online learning some teachers may want to make things more difficult to make sure students are working for their grade but her quizzes were ridiculous."
3,2.0,4.0, PSYCH2376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"Overall, the coursework is light and doable. However, she's very careful about her word choice on the exams. I would take 5-6 pages worth of notes a week on her lectures and still fail her quizzes. The content itself is fun to learn, but I didn't enjoy it as much when she made it extremely complicated. A little ridiculous for a Tier 2 course."
4,4.0,2.0, PSYCH2376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"I thought the class was overall pretty easy. I studied around 3 hours before exam and always got an A. However, the final wasn't cumulative and so I studied how I usually did for other exams and I absolutely bombed it and got a D. She ended up curving the class so I got an A so it didn't matter. Overall, it was easy except for the final"
5,2.0,4.0, PSYCH2376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"The book isn't required, but it explains the material better than her. Her tests are based on examples from lectures. Her powerpoints suck. There isn't much to boost your grade. Tests are very difficult. She allows you to earn 0.5 points of extra credit during tests. Test averages are really low in the class."
6,5.0,3.0, PSYCH520,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"In this class you have 10 weeks to come up with an experiment idea, create the experiment, analyze your data, and write a research paper. If you can't handle the amount of time that will obviously take then don't take the class. Dr. Libby did a great job of presenting the material in way that made the class a lot easier than I was expecting."
7,4.0,4.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"Dr. Libby is a good professor,however,she needs to improve her teaching style and provide students with study guides/review sheets to help them prepare better for the exams,because there is a lot of material to remember,which is overwhelming and a bit like a guessing game,because you never know what to expect on the exams.(I failed all 3 of them!)"
8,4.0,4.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"loved the info in class, but very specific. tests were hard, averages for midterm were in 70's, final average was a 68%. opportunities for 4 extra credit, fairly easy to obtain. exams are VERY difficult. 2 ""discussions"" to attend with 10 other students, easy points. overall, good teacher but hard exams. read book for first exam, not for others."
9,1.0,5.0, PSYCH520,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,I've loved every psychology class I have ever taken at Ohio State... until I had Dr. Libby for a professor. I would rather drink molten glass than have to deal with her again.
10,2.5,5.0, PSYCH520,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"She might not use a textbook or give tests or quizzes, but she is sadistic when it comes to classwork. Plan on reading at least 3 journal articles a day, writing 1 to 2 papers a week, and when it comes to research she is the pickiest person in the world. Avoid at all costs, unless you plan to cancel everything else in your life for 3 months."
11,1.0,5.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"AVOID. I was so excited to take this class but I nearly failed bc of frustraction. Her teaching style did not match book which did not match notes which did not match test. 1/2 MC half essay but hard grader (nit picky...if not exactly clear no points) EC is joke, 1/2 class did not know answ. BLAHHHH"
12,4.0,4.0, PSYCH520,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"Decent class; good experience if looking at graduate school in psych. A bit unclear and slow at answering emails. Sometimes seemed like she shoved a lot of her dirty work on her TA. If you haven't taken psych 321, just be prepared for some frustration when it comes to reporting data. fast-paced and quick deadlines, but no tests or book."
13,4.5,4.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,pretty good class. as long as you study well you should do fine. very clear in her teaching and standards.
14,5.0,3.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"This class is a scientific study of human relationships, so you can't go into it expecting something out of Cosmopolitan. That said, I thought the subject matter was very interesting and the tests weren't THAT hard. She is straightforward and clear, and more personable 1-on-1. She's also very willing to help. Kinda cute in a professor-ish way."
15,3.5,4.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"Hardest, trickiest (essay) exams ever! They don't test knowledge directly, they ask you to infer things from what she talked about. And she's boring as crap. Explains relationships in terms of  evolution. What a joke! Disappointing. If you're interested in relationships, just buy the textbook on eBay and avoid this class at all costs."
16,2.5,4.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,The class could have been so much better! She is pretty boring for how great the subject matter could have been.  Tests are some of the hardest I have had in my 4 years in the Psych department.  She offers lots of extra credit but its only worth half a point.  It was overall a disappointment
17,5.0,4.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"Prof libby is great.  her class is kind of interesting, no homework assignments just 3 exams.  3 discussion sessions per quarter and you only have to attend two..super easy.  test's aren't the best, but definitely not hard.  if you study a little you'll be sure to get an A, B-"
18,3.5,4.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"I found this course to be difficult and rewarding at the same time. I thought the Sex and the Cty clips worked well with the material. The tests were rather difficult, but there were plenty of opportunities for extra credit if you bothered to show up"
19,4.5,1.0, PSYCH376,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"One of the best professors I've ever had.  Very reasonable in her expectations.  I thought the exams were extremely easy, but some people had trouble with them.  My favorite course in all 4 of my years at OSU.  Material is very interesting!"
20,5.0,3.0, PSYCH367,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,LISA,LIBBY,"If you are interested in relationships, and how to make them better you will like this class. She is monotone and boring. Tests are somewhat difficult. I learned stuff from the book."
