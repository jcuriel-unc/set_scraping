1,1.0,4.0, SOC3410,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"Try to avoid this professor at all costs. Lectures everyday, at least 50 pages of reading per night from the textbook. VERY difficult grader. Be prepared to be yelled at A LOT. She gets very upset when students do not understand the subjects at the level she does. If you haven't already look her up! She doesn't care about her students whatsoever. "
2,4.0,4.0, SOC209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"Sociology is not as easy as it seems. A lot of readings and a lot of quizzes and assignments. Yes, she is a fantastic professor. The course had a lot work and was very writing-heavy. She definitely makes you work hard for your grade which is great. She gives you extra credit too."
3,5.0,3.0, SOC211,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,Dr. Bryant is by far my favorite professor Ive had at OSU campus. She has been my driving factor in getting involved in social justice efforts and my career path has been heavily influenced by her teachings. I highly suggest taking her inside out class as it was definitely a life changing experience and provided me with a new outlook on CJ system
4,4.0,4.0, SOC209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"As long as you do the readings from the textbook you will receive an 'A'. My only complaint is that she will go off on liberal tangents and went as far as to say, ""Why don't white people just shut up!"" as if to say white people didn't have grounds to talk about minority issues."
5,4.0,2.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"She read through PowerPoint slides but also got off topic and asked students to pitch in. Very down to earth. Friendly. Easy to understand the class. Intro to Sociology so not very difficult to learn, if not already known knowledge. Lots of tests but only includes one question, easy grader, must read chapters/book to  pass."
6,3.5,2.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"Professor Harvey was really nice and the class was fairly easy. There was no final exam, just a final paper and a presentation that had to be done. Both were pretty easy. She was always willing to help me whenever I needed it. The only thing I didn't like was that some of the questions on the quizzes and papers that she handed out were confusing."
7,5.0,1.0, SOC209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"Her class wasn't hard, and she had notes on Carmen which helped a lot since you couldn't really keep up with the slides and her talking. No final just a really easy paper. And the quizzes and test weren't hard at all."
8,5.0,4.0, SOC211,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,Angela is great! This class takes place in a prison and is very interesting. It has tons of readings and writtings but honestly its well worth the work. The class is wonderful and shes an amazing professor. I try to take every class she teaches. I have taken 3 so far and all of them have been grea!!!!
9,4.0,3.0, SOC211,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"Had her for an inside out course... Very interesting class and she gave everyone an equal opportunity to participate. There were a ton of papers, but no tests or final. I would definitely recommend her to anyone. I actually plan on taking another class of hers"
10,4.5,3.0, SOC209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,I loved her class i took it last year and i plan to talk the inside out course soon. shes very nice and understanding :) her test are fair.
11,2.0,3.0, SOCIO101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"I took this class with Angela Harvey during my freshman year at Ohio State. Even now as a senior, it still stands out in my head as the worst experience I've had at OSU and is also by far the worst grade I have ever received in college. She's an unfair grader and a poor lecturer. Look at her Arizona State listing for more information."
12,5.0,2.0, SOC209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,I love Angela! She is a great professor and you can tell she loves what she is doing. You must attend her classes to pass because there is in class work. Her class is very interesting and I highly recommend taking any of her classes! She is great!
13,3.0,2.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"She is very nice and very smart. She is very involved and interested in teaching her subject. She makes it hard to participate in class discussions, but overall the class was great."
14,3.0,2.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"I enjoyed the class alot. The professor was very interested in the subject, but made it difficult to participate in class discussions. But she is very understanding and a lenient grader."
15,2.0,5.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"Not good at involving class in discussion. During the time I was in her class, she lectured to the left side of the front row. For people sitting anywhere else, it was often hard to participate in class discussion. strange grading and poorly made/written power points also hurt the quality of the class. Definitely, a teacher to avoid if possible."
16,2.0,5.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"Worst teacher I have ever had in my three years at OSU.                          If you end up taking a class with this professor, hope that you get on her good side. She strikes me as more than willing to set aside normal objective thinking when it comes to evaluating her students. Also, her PPPs are full of very bad mistakes."
17,4.0,2.0, SOCIO294,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"i loved this class, angela worked so hard to pull it together. she put a lot of pressure on us, and sometimes it was really frustrating, like she needed a chill pill, but well worth it, and i totally respect her for it."
18,4.0,2.0, SOCIO294,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"loved the class, angela worked her ass off for this, but she also put a lot of pressure on us, and at times, i think she was a little over the top. she just needs to relax and do some yoga or something sometimes. :)"
19,3.5,4.0, SOC101,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"She is very nice and very smart. She expects things to be in when she says they need to be in. I learned a lot from her but it wasn't really exciting. She talks a lot and shows power points. The movies she shows are great, and the material isn't to hard. The exams are long I suggest studying!!"
20,4.0,2.0, SOC209,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ANGELA,BRYANT,"There was only one test, a midterm. the final was media project. She did different thigns each class in order to take attendance. sometimes a quiz..sometimes just writing your name on a piece of paper! They were easy gimmee points!!"
