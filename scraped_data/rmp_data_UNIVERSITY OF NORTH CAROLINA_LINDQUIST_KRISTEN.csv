1,5.0,2.0, NSCI395,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KRISTEN,LINDQUIST,"Dr. Lindquist was a great choice for NSCI 395! This is mostly independent research in which she is not too involved, but she will give you guidance on the paper or any logistics if you ever need help. She is super easygoing, and if you do your work, it's hard not to get an A. "
2,5.0,3.0, PSYC693,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KRISTEN,LINDQUIST,"I had Dr. Lindquist for the class portion of the Senior Honors Thesis in Psychology this past semester. She was a great professor! She's a researcher too, so she's very knowledgable about thesis-related things."

5,5.0,2.0, PSYC68,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KRISTEN,LINDQUIST,"Easily my favorite class during my first year. Dr. Lindquist is incredibly knowledgeable and is a leader in the field. She's really down to earth and is pretty light on her grading. Interesting material, too. While the final project can be a lot of work, it's also pretty fun. A fantastic seminar!"

7,5.0,3.0, PSYC68,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KRISTEN,LINDQUIST,Professor Lindquist made class very interesting and engaging. She clearly was very knowledgeable and wanted us to learn as much as we could. I would get excited to come to class even though it was a late class on Fridays. I would highly recommend taking any class she teaches!
8,5.0,2.0, PSYC68,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KRISTEN,LINDQUIST,Do anything you can to have her as a teacher.
9,5.0,2.0, PSYC68,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,KRISTEN,LINDQUIST,"She knows her stuff.  She's intelligent and very well spoken but is never condescending.  You don't have to like psychology to enjoy the class. There was a lot of outside reading of scientific articles, but you can skip or skim one here and there, and you'll  be absoultely fine! She also provided study guides for exams. Very inspiring class!"
