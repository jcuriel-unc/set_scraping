1,4.0,4.0, PSCY101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Attending class is mandatory, as she says things during class that do not appear in the readings. I'm not a science person and thought this class was difficult because of the amount of science-based terminology in the first half of the class, but not impossible. Would highly encourage to read the lectures and start studying several days in advance."
2,5.0,3.0, PSCY101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Dr. Loeb is an amazing professor. Her lectures are super engaging and fun; she explains concepts in a way that makes so much sense. Textbook readings can be a lot, make sure to start in advance. She clearly loves psychology and is so knowledgeable on the subject. I can not recommend her enough, if you are taking psyc 101 take it with Dr. Loeb!"
3,4.0,3.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Loeb is a great professor and obviously cares a lot about what she teaches. She does not post any slides to go back and look at outside of class, so make sure you go to class to get the information. Take good notes for the exams, they are tough, but manageable if you go to CLASS. Loeb was a great professor, but I am glad Psych 101 is done. "
4,5.0,2.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Dr. Loeb is awesome. She makes lectures engaging and interesting. With that said, to do well on exams attendance is mandatory and you MUST read the textbook. This class also had the most extra credit opportunities I have ever had in a college course."
5,4.0,3.0, 101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Dr. Loeb is very nice and generous with grades. Her funny anecdotes seem initially engaging, but eventually became corny and irrelevant. Exams weren't a great indicator of core content mastery, more regurgitation of niche class examples. Class is run by TAs, which can lead to confusion. Overall, a decent experience with a few hiccups along the way."
6,5.0,3.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Great professor, engaging lectures. Exams can be tricky, so be sure to read the textbook and attend lectures. 10/10. "
7,5.0,3.0, 101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Dr. Loeb is honestly so amazing. She's very passionate, her lectures are intriguing, she's witty, and she gives a lot of extra credit for the students to succeed. Although her exams can be tough, the class is not predominantly exam-grade-based. I love her and I would definitely take her again. "
8,5.0,2.0, PSCY101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,I loved this professor. The tests were very easy and reflected the content. As long as you download her notes outlines and read it will be fairly easy. She also curves A LOT. The first test she curved 8.5 points. She is funny and her lectures are super engaging. The only slightly annoying thing is the heavily weighted attendance policy.
9,5.0,3.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Prof Loeb is amazing. Great lectures, very clear grading and class outline, and relates well to students. Class isn't hard if you do the readings and pay attention. Would absolutely take her class again. "
10,4.0,4.0, PSYCH101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Loeb has very engaging lectures and knows her stuff. However, your tests count for a lot of your grade, and they're definitely difficult. If you're not good at applying content/info, then be prepared b/c the tests are all application. Participation matters. I really enjoyed the class and her lectures, but I have found it difficult to keep an A. "
11,5.0,4.0, 101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"LOVE Dr. Loeb. Tests are definitely hard and there is a lot of reading, but she is genuinely so caring. Lectures were always hilarious and she is so passionate about the subject. Definitely a good balance of difficulty, and I learned a lot. "
12,5.0,3.0, 101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Dr. Loeb is awesome!!!! Great lecturer, very engaging. Lots of opportunities for points/ to boost your grade. Heavy on reading but if you do it, exams are not difficult. Participation is a big part of your grade!"
13,5.0,4.0, PSCY101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,She is very kind and understanding! There are many opportunities for extra credit but the exams can be pretty difficult. If you study and read the textbook this class should be pretty easy. 
14,5.0,3.0, PSCY101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Prof. Loeb is genuinely one of the best teachers I've ever had. Even in a 200-300 person lecture hall it was so easy to learn from her. She makes content relatable and always cracks jokes. There is so many opportunities for EC and as long as you stay on pace with textbook readings and listen to lectures, it's a super easy course, def. recommend!"
15,5.0,2.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"If you read the textbook, take good notes and pay a little bit of attention during class then it'll be easy, you just need to study a bit before each exam. she gives a lot of extra credit and bonus points on exams, so it boosts your grade by a lot"
16,5.0,4.0, PSYC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Loved Professor Loeb. Super interactive and does extra credit if you answer questions or participate. Her in-class assignment, which shows you are present in class, are not graded on accuracy, which is nice, but she usually tells the answer eventually. Great at making topics relatable to students."
17,5.0,3.0, 101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Lots of extra credit opportunities. Loeb is a great lecturer and the class is super interesting. We have quizzes which are easy, exams aren't difficult but do require a lot of studying/memorization. Reading the textbook is important. Attendance isn't technically mandatory but there are in class assignments you can only complete if you go. "
18,5.0,2.0, 101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"Favorite professor so far at UNC. Lectures are witty, entertaining, and easy to follow. She is very well spoken and makes psychology fascinating. The workload consists of one-two textbook readings a week, which are 30 pages and come with an easy quiz. Exams are considered to be tough, but your reading notes help and she gives exam extra credit!"
19,5.0,3.0, PYSC101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,"passionate prof. She changed tests to closed notes 3 weeks prior to the exam after the drop period; however, she gave a massive bonus credit. Lots of extra credit. I would recommend doing these things to get a good grade... read EVERYTHING, take notes, annotate note outlines she gives, find examples for concepts.
Great prof, I highly recommend!"
20,5.0,4.0, PSCY101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,JEANNIE,LOEB,Dr. Loeb is really entertaining and I would recommend taking 101 with her because she makes boring material seem interesting. The tests are pretty difficult but she gave us a 20-point bonus on the first one due to a syllabus error and is allowing notes on the final because she doesn't want people to stress out. Lots of ways to get bonus credit!
