1,3.0,4.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,Genuinely nice guy but class consist of just discussion by students. This works great for some but I struggle with theory and would have preferred for him to lecture and tell me the important things I need to know. Left the class often with more questions then when I first came and feeling like I had just wasted my time. 
2,5.0,4.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,"Dr. Kurzman is so kind and really cares about his students. 2 online exams which are open note, and 3 papers which are very difficult but doable. There are notes due on the readings every class, which take up quite a good amount of time but help you greatly with your understanding."
3,5.0,2.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,"Reading questions are helpful, but there is a good bit of reading. That & attendance will help your grade tremendously. Papers are not difficult and exams are open-note. As long as you read and take good reading notes, this class will be a breeze. "
4,5.0,3.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,"This class is foundational and the content is very important. It can be rough at times because you have to turn in daily reading notes and read sometimes dense theory, but he makes it the best it can be by condensing readings and guiding learning. Dr. Kurzman is so kind, clearly loves the material, and updates the newer theories taught."
5,5.0,3.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,"Doing the reading is critical- it is a theory class. Class mainly comprises answering questions students have on the homework. the readings can be boring and hard but many are really interesting. He does a great job of trying to incorporate diversity within the required readings. 3 papers(30%),midterm(15%),final(15%), readings(20%), attendance(20%)"
6,5.0,3.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,Dr. Kurzman has been one of my favorite professors here at UNC. I have taken 2 classes with him. He is one of the most understanding and kind people you will meet. He is respectful towards everyone in the class and values all student's perspectives. I 10/10 recommend taking any class that he teaches!
7,5.0,2.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,Dr. Kurzman is a gem. I would not have wanted to take this class with any other professor. He is really knowledgeable and tries to incorporate some kind of activity in each lecture. I will note attendance is mandatory and there are reading notes due before each class. But I honestly felt like I learned so much in this class. 10/10
8,5.0,5.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,"For this class, readings were accessible and didn't require purchasing textbooks. He is knowledgeable, respectful, and flexible to meet during office hours. He is strict on exams and grading work. He gave great lectures and completed his goals for this class. Preparation and organization in this class are key to passing. Not an essay A."
9,3.0,3.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,"Prof Kurzman is very knowledgeable about everything we learned in class but is a very tough grader. The mandatory reading notes are easy and a great grade boost. On tests there is only one right answer, so if you don't answer it exactly how he would like you won't get the points. He is very helpful in office hours, especially regarding the 3 papers"
10,3.0,4.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,Professor Kurzman has very clear guidelines for assignments but is a harsh grader and counts off for the smallest things. Each point you miss off of an assignment is a point off of your final grade. Readings are time consuming and sometimes boring but he is very knowledgeable about the subject and he genuinely care if you learn the material
11,4.0,4.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,"Professor Kurzman was a solid choice for SOCI250. The class itself is difficult but, he is really caring and is open to questions. There is a lot of work but, it is all purposeful and helps on midterm and final exam. I recommend if you don't mind mandatory class meetings and reading notes due every day (which are not as bad as they sound)!"
12,3.0,5.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,I think he makes social theory about as interesting as it could possibly be.  You can tell he is very knowledgeable about what he teaches.  He is a very tough grader.
13,4.0,4.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,He's a great teacher and really cares about whether you know the material or not. The papers and test are HARD but if you do the (mandatory) reading notes every day then it shouldn't be too bad.
14,2.0,4.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,Kurzman is a difficult lecturer and even more difficult grader. The paper assignments are ludicrous
15,4.5,3.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,"Kurzman is an AWESOME sociology professor. The course material doesn't exactly lend itself to fascination, but Kurzman is clear and explains exactly what you need to know. The exams aren't bad as long as you listen to his instructions and they are open book so be sure to take notes verbatim. He is great."
16,4.0,4.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,"I guess he hasn't taught this in a few years, but he must've gotten better because he is AMAZING. Generally this would be a super boring course, but Kurzman makes it simple, clear and to the point. He grades kind of hard, but it willing to work with you. Learned so much, which I needed as a soci major."
17,4.5,1.0, SOCI250,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,CHARLES,KURZMAN,"I loved this class. The subject matter can seem obscure at times (Foucault, Haraway, etc) but Kurzman's lectures are engaging and clear. However, the TA's were painfully out of sync with the material. As long as you do all the work, an A is guaranteed. Definitely worth it."
