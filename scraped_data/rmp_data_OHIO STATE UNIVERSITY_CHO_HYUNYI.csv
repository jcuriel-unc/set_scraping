As it turns out, Professor Cho is amazing and a great teacher! She doesn't try to trick you on exams or assignments, but genuinely wants to know that you understand the content and are learning. "

The weekly workload was more than manageable, the readings were relevant and useful, and the concepts from lecture were applied outside of class. Do your due diligence in this class and you will learn some great information!"

I loved her class and it was super interesting to take during the corona crisis. I highly recommend her, her exams are easy, her lectures are straight forward and she is awesome!"
