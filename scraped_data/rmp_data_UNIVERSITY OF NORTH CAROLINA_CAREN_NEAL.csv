1,3.0,1.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"Extremely passive aggressive professor, but overall a very easy class. I took SOCI100 and it was rather interesting, but the way he lectured was terribly boring. On-time submission will typically lead to an 100% on the assignment, except the final and midterm were significantly more difficult. Staying on top of reading the textbook definitely helps"
2,1.0,5.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"Overall one of the worst professors I have experienced at UNC Chapel Hill. His lectures covered trivial topics that had no relevance whatsoever to the test material. Furthermore I can confidently say I left his class with a lower IQ than I entered thanks to his abstract ""Sociological"" Theories. 10/10 would recommend he gets let go!"
3,4.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"Dr. Caren is great! The exams are the hardest part of the class, so definitely take the practice tests many times. However, there are a lot of other assignments to balance out exam grades. The final exam included questions from the midterms, so definitely go back and review those questions when the final comes along. Very knowledgeable guy. "
4,2.0,5.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"Lectures are not helpful, just read the books. Hard to get good grades. The class has tons of assignments. However, the exams largely determined the grade (so even if you got 100 on every other assignment you might still mess the grades up) and it test literally everything. Never got exam scores higher than 85 and ends up with an A-."
5,3.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"The lectures and readings for this class can be pretty long. The class consists of applications, case studies, film discussions, inquizitive, midterms, and the final. TA's are great and allow you to resubmit applications if necessary. You need to thoroughly study all of the vocabulary in the textbook. Take practice tests MULTIPLE TIMES. "
6,5.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"Grading criteria is super clear. You can get a decent grade without putting in much effort. Lecture can be interesting and Neal is knowledgeable. The exams are likely the worst part of the class but even then, the reviews and Quizlet help with studying. Overall, not a bad course if you're looking for an interesting elective that isn't too rigorous."
7,5.0,2.0, SOCI274,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"Neal Caren, I love you so much. Best professor I've ever had hands down. I took this for PH credit and had so much fun. Truly got to be me in this class and have never had a better time. Neal literally catered IP3 for our final... king. Easy A if you put in a little bit of effort and honestly such a rewarding class... gonna miss this class so much"
8,5.0,3.0, SOCI274,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,I was super nervous about Caren's 274 section because the teaching method was so unusual (you have to take on the perspective of historical figures) but I learned so much and this class was something I looked forward to. Dr. Caren is super chill and we had a pizza party during our final if that says anything. Take this class!!!
9,5.0,3.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,Dude is hilarious and clearly knows a lot about sociology. Assignments are fairly easy to complete and have very clear grading criteria. Has offered extra credit opportunities throughout the semester as well. Tests are pretty difficult so I recommend actually studying for a couple days in advance. Very helpful and has interesting classes as well. 
10,5.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"Prof Caren is funny and his lectures always have something that make me laugh. Multiple extra credit opportunities. Know the key terms/do the practice exams before exams and you should do well. Not a hard class to succeed in if you put in some effort and understand the material, was never stressed about this class. "
11,5.0,3.0, SOCI274,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"Super knowledgeable and great at facilitating a hands-off experience where students can truly immerse themselves in the simulation. Will help when you're stuck. A lot of reading is required to truly understand the material, and you have to put in a lot of effort, but it's worth it. Grading not bad. Class is different, but my favorite one I've taken"
12,4.0,3.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"Assignments have clear grading criteria and are relatively easy although time consuming. Tests are pretty hard, definitely need to put a good amount of time into studying. "
13,5.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"pretty easy as long as you do the work and study, many movie days and few papers and case studys but nothing too difficult"
14,5.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"I really loved Professor Caren. He was engaging in class and had very clear expectations. His tests are not hard if you take the practice exams he posts a couple of times (there are infinite questions). The applications every week are not hard ... I don't think they are actually graded for content, got 100 on all of them. "
15,4.0,3.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"Professor Caren is an AMAZING guy. His classes are fun, entertaining and thought provoking. However, the tests are disproportionately hard compared to his lectures, so be prepared to not do well on those versus other assignments. Overall, highly suggest his course."
16,2.0,4.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,He's a chill guy and a nice person but there's way too much work he makes you do for a stupid intro to sociology class. Every other teacher gives less work - he's so extra and for no reason. Would have never taken this class if I knew that he made you work like a donkey for even a B.
17,2.0,3.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,The lectures and readings for this class are so boring. There isn't enough engagement in class to keep you focused it's just him talking for 1 hour and 15 minutes straight. The applications also take you a long time and the due dates are too short for a project of that manner. Midterms are okay it's just memorizing like 100+ terms.
18,5.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"SUCH a great professor. Super easy class if you just do the PRACTICE EXAMS MULTIPLE TIMES. Some of the exam answers are on Quizlet if you know where to look; hint use practice exam problems to search. Great and engaging professor. DON'T READ TEXTBOOK. Complete waste of time, j skim for answers and study vocabulary."
19,5.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,Prof Caren is an extremely nice professor. He chooses interesting documentaries to watch and is funny with the lectures. He is well respected by the class and there is no way you can get less than a B in this class unless you genuinely do not do anything. Love him!
20,5.0,2.0, SOCI101,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,NEAL,CAREN,"Professor Caren is a delightful professor. He's kind, funny, and does his best to keep students engaged during lecture. However, much of what is required to succeed in this course comes from the textbook, not the lectures. As long as you do the required readings, the class shouldn't be too difficult."
