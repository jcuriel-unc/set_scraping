Criminal Investigation is the most interesting class I had this semester, and he did a great job of making it easy to understand. He always gives personalized feedback if you miss points, and assignments are straightforward and easy. Overall great class and even better professor. "

He is so understanding about if you need to turn in things late, and his quizzes and tests are easy if you just copy the notes from the lecture videos. Super sweet man, and he really cares about what he teaches! Overall amazing class."
