1,3.0,1.0, POL4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"His lectures are okay. There can be really interesting content, but sometimes he just goes on unrelated rants. He says he's a realist every time he gets a chance and says some really out of pocket stuff sometimes but in a funny way. Class is super easy though, I would take it if you need a GPA boost."
2,4.0,1.0, POL4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"Apparently Schweller is famous in the IR field and a fine teacher who explains different IR theories well. Easy class - never showed up in person, watched a few recordings, grinded on the paper before ddl, and got 100% on both midterm and final. "
3,4.0,1.0, POL4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,Never showed up and got an A. Didn't learn anything. 
4,5.0,2.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"Dr Schweller is one of the most interesting teachers I have had at OSU. All of his lectures are interesting, and they are extremely helpful to expanding the way you think critically about international politics. Even his inane ramblings are interesting. The readings are very well chosen. Cannot recommend this Professor enough"
5,3.0,2.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"Professor Schweller had some interesting lectures, but would also go on random rants about weird stuff (he's very pro-Trump, and has a tendency to talk over people even if they agree with him). The course itself is not hard at all - a couple of big exams that are very hard to do badly on."
6,3.0,1.0, POLISCI4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,Class is graded by two tests and nothing else. He posts all of the lecture notes and powerpoints online. Also posts the midterm and final so you know exactly what will be on them. Will constantly tell you he's a realist. Amazing course to take during the pandemic. You won't regret it.
7,1.0,2.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"Professor Schweller is super opinionated. His lectures are extremely boring but not necessary as long as you understand the general concepts/theories from the powerpoints. The only grades are a midterm and final, and both are essays (he's not a hard grader). Overall, an easy class, but my least favorite professor ever."
8,5.0,1.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,Professor Schweller is awesome! He doesn't want to tank your GPA or make your life difficult for no reason. The entire class is graded by your midterm and final. He gives you plenty of resources on Carmen (including past tests ;) ) I 100% recommend taking this class.
9,4.0,1.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"Prof. Schwellers class was very, very easy. Our final exam was completely opinion-based, and we didnt have to cite any of the class material for the essay. He doesnt care about killing your GPA and making your life miserable for a semester  he really just wants you to learn, and thats your choice if you do or not. Hes a nice guy!"
10,5.0,4.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,Professor Schweller is an amazing professor! Hes really laid back and doesnt try to make your life miserable! Hes very precise with the exam questions and if you pay attention in class youll pull through with an A. Class is all exams and little to no extra credit.
11,3.0,1.0, POLITSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,The only way to not get an A is if you literally don't try *at all*. Exam questions are given beforehand. However because of this the class was honestly kind of boring and not worth going to. He's nice but doesn't really care about undergrads but that's not all that unfamiliar in the poli sci department.
12,5.0,1.0, PS4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"This class is dumb easy. Only grades are the midterm and final, but he gives you the questions beforehand and only makes you write a response for 1 or 2 of them. He also gives you the answers to all the questions the lecture before both exams. Dr Schweller is very knowledgeable and decently funny, so lectures arent bad either"
13,4.0,1.0, PS4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"Incredibly easy A, but it's a bit boring because of that. Reading isn't required, there's no homework, and there is one midterm and one final, which he grades pretty easily. If you're looking for an easy A this is the class, but if you want something more intellectually stimulating I would find another class."
14,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"Wonderful professor, very caring towards students, and offered to meet students over coffee rather than sit in an office. Wants to see everyone do well, and get an A. Will only be graded for midterm and final, but as long as you attend class, read your notes routinely, and ask questions, you will get an A."
15,5.0,1.0, POLITSC4315,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"Really easy A. Literally show up to class and study a bit for the two exams and you'll get an A. That being sad, he's a really intelligent man with unique ideas, and he loves hearing from his students. If you go to class, you'll learn quite a bit."
16,3.0,2.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"A midterm and a final, each worth 50% of your grade. Gives you the essay questions ahead of time, so if you prepare even a little bit for the exams you'll definitely pass if not get an A. In my class over 70% got As on the midterm."
17,5.0,2.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,Class lectures can be very dry if you're not into Polisci. He is very laid back and it shows in the class. There are only two grades in the class. A midterm and final. Both are essays that he gives you ahead of time and grades them with a ton of leniency. He is a realist and not afraid to share his opinion
18,5.0,3.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"interesting, relatively easy class"
19,3.0,1.0, POLITSC4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,"He's a good, easy going professor but in case you couldn't tell he reminds you daily that he is a realist"
20,5.0,2.0, INTSTDS4300,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,RANDALL,SCHWELLER,Dr. Schweller is a great professor. This class isn't hard because he makes it clear that he's not trying to make your life hard for no reason. He wants people to get A's and learn. Class always gets out early and he is always available to talk.
