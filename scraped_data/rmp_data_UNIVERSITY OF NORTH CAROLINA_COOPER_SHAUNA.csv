1,4.0,1.0, PSYC54,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHAUNA,COOPER,Easy first year seminar and she is a really understanding professor. Very low stress class so I'd recommend for anyone looking for an easy FYS.
2,5.0,1.0, PSYC54,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHAUNA,COOPER,"Professor Cooper has all the qualities that a first-year seminar instructor should. She is understanding, flexible, and care's about her students. She is also very knowledgable about what she teaches. The class was easy as long as you show up for attendance. A few papers make up the majority of your grades and the topics are easy to write about."
3,5.0,1.0, PSYC54,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHAUNA,COOPER,"Professor Cooper is seriously amazing. I learned SO much in this class, and it was super easy. 3 papers (2 because of COVID), a take-home midterm, and that's pretty much it. If this course is offered and you need a fun class, definitely take it!"
4,5.0,1.0, PSYC467,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHAUNA,COOPER,"Dr. Cooper is one of the most caring and engaging professors I've had at UNC. We had a total of 3 papers all semester, but she's very flexible and gives extra credit opportunities. As long as you show your enthusiasm for her class and show up regularly, you'll pass."
5,5.0,2.0, PSYC54,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,SHAUNA,COOPER,"I loved this class. The topics were really interesting and she is really good at helping you understand them. As long as you pay attention and put some effort into assignments, you can definitely get an A. She is really helpful and makes the class pretty fun!"
