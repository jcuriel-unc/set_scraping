1,5.0,2.0, POLITISCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,"AMAZING professor. Lectures are interesting & easy to follow. A lot of her class is based on Cambodia because that's where she does her research. Extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Let's you retake any assignment/midterm/quiz/paper. The simulation is very fun. No final, just a final paper. She wants you to succeed."
2,5.0,2.0, POLISCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,This woman is incredible- I was recommended to take her through my advisor and she is everything I couldve asked for. I mean it when I say she should teach every PoliSci class at OSU. Her lectures are easy to take notes on and she really cares about your education rather than giving you a grade. Take her class!!!
3,5.0,2.0, POLISCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,"Erin is an absolutely wonderful professor! She is very kind and understanding, giving amazing lectures. The simulation was very fun and was one of my favorite parts of the class. Highly suggest taking any class with Professor Lin!"
4,5.0,2.0, POLITSC3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,"Erin Lin is by far the best professor. She is so sweet and caring. My course was online (covid). Our midterm was able to be retaken, and the simulation she has us do is so fun and easy points if you are involved and do the work. The final paper is long but she grades easy so I got an A on it. Overall an enjoyable class an a great professor"
5,5.0,3.0, POLITSC3225,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,"Professor Lin is one of the most intelligent women I have come across. The class structure is based on simulations from real world conflicts which is unlike any class I have taken before. The papers are extremely manageable and the class set-up is extremely productive, thanks to her organization and experience! Would highly recommend!"
6,5.0,2.0, POLISCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,Amazing professor. Highly recommend her class. Its easy but you will learn a lot if you show up and pay attention.
7,5.0,2.0, POLITSC3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,"Dr. Lin is one of the best professors you will have at OSU. She is intelligent, engaging, understanding, and hilarious. Show up to class, take some notes, and you'll get an A."
8,5.0,3.0, POLISCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,"She is such a funny, personable, and incredibly intelligent professor. She really engages in conversation with us during lecture, and makes her incredibly difficult, graduate-level readings easy to understand in lecture! Make sure to go to her office hours and get to know her. Her and her TA help so much with papers and tests, so use them!"
9,5.0,3.0, PS3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,"Dr. Lin is really funny, super smart, and explains hard concepts really clearly. I really loved her class! if you put the work in, you'll get an A, and it's not a ton of work. Readings are all pretty easy, and she goes over them in class, so even if you have trouble, you'll come out understanding it. Tests and quizzes are really fair."
10,4.0,2.0, POLISCI3225,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,"Different style of teaching, mostly lectures but with ""simulations"" throughout the class. Some are interesting, graded on participation. Just show up and you'll get an A. Readings are extremely long and difficult but we go over them in class so you don't really have to fully understand them. One midterm and one short paper."
11,5.0,3.0, POLISCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,"I learned a lot from Dr. Lin. She goes over the readings in all of her lectures, so be sure to come to class. While the readings are tough, her explanations are very clear and engaging. Be careful of the exams though, they were actually pretty tough. If the class average is low, she will provide various extra credit opportunities. Great class."
12,5.0,3.0, POLISCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,"She's awesome. Very clear in explaining the readings in lecture, very good at answering questions. She genuinely cares about the subject material and teaching the course, and the class simulations are a great way to get ""hands-on"" experience with what she teaches. Definitely going to take a class with her again."
13,5.0,3.0, POLITSCI3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,"Hands down the best professor I've ever had. She teaches you so much and in such an original way with the simulations, and though her midterms can be a bit difficult, she goes out of her way to make sure everyone that works hard ultimately succeeds. I wish I could take all of my classes with her, honestly."
14,5.0,1.0, POLITSC3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,Prof. Lin Is a great professor. She has a vast knowledge that she is willing to share. If you show up to the class the course is very simple. If you skip good luck... There are reading assigned every day that she spends the entire lecture going over. I did not read any of the reading but made sure I went to class every day and did fine.
15,5.0,4.0, POLITSC3220,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,ERIN,LIN,I really liked the simulations that she would do. Each student would get a different character (randomly selected) and you would try to create the best course for the simulation country. Professor Lin is very smart and participation in class is the best way for a good grade.
