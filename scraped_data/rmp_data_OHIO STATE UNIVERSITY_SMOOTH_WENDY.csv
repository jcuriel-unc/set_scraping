1,2.0,3.0, WGSST3575,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"Professor Smooth is extremely disorganized. While it is evident that she is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about course content, she does not communicate clearly with students. She made this course very confusing."
2,1.0,5.0, WGSST1110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"I took this class because I needed it for a GE and it was all that was open, had I known more about it I would have just taken less credits. Professor Smooth had her way or the high way, if you disagreed with her opinion then you were wrong. Her lectures were long and had nothing to do with what we were actually learning."
3,3.0,4.0, WGSST1110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,Dr. Smooth was a great lecturer and is really passionate about Women's Gender Studies but oftentimes she would just lecture off tangent on things that we (the class) weren't sure of the relevance to the test. If you are passionate about Women's Studies this class will be easy but attendance is mandatory and the TAs are tough paper graders.
4,3.5,4.0, WGS110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,Dr. Smooth is awesome! She is such a positive beginning to my mornings and her lectures are great! The TAs on the other hand...
5,1.5,5.0, 4403,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"While Smooth is a huge part of Ohio States WGGS program and is super intelligent, lectures stink. I can only recall a handful of times she wrote on the board. The readings are so extensive but you have to read them to actually understand lecture. brownie points: print the material and highlight she loves that! material is great; she ruins the fun"
6,1.0,5.0, 4403,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"She's very unprepared and the whole class is just her lecturing and talking about all the reading you have to do somehow. Her expectations are wildly too high. She never responds to emails. She takes this class too seriously. I would NEVER recommend anyone take this class. While the material is interesting, she ruins it."
7,3.0,4.0, WGSST110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"women studies 110 isn't an easy A but it's def very possible. Smooth was pretty good, but I loved my TA, Jackie. She made the class so much more interesting because of discussion during recitation. I didn't expect to fall in love with this class but I did, it's one of those classes that have the potential to impact you for the rest of your life"
8,1.0,4.0, WGSST110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"THIS CLASS WAS SOOOOOOOOO BORING TO ME! She seem happy to teach us but we never really got through anything because spent WAY too much time talking on and on and on and on and on about one topic. I did not learn nothing from this class. Also her ""helpers"" was NOT very ""helpful"" at ALLLLL. Overall I would not recommend any one to take this class!!!"
9,2.5,2.0, WOSTD110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"Too much work for a 100 level class! You have to write 5 papers, go to outside events, and tons of reading! However, the class material is pretty interesting and eye-opening."
10,4.0,4.0, WGSST110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,I loved this class. I looked forward to it everyday I had it. Although you don't get lots of one on one time with Dr. Smooth she has such a passion that it is very enjoyable.
11,5.0,4.0, WMST110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"Dr. Smooth  really made me think. She is not easy, there's a lot of reading, but it is worth it. She made me think about so many things. I took the class last year and I am still thinking about it. She really made me get it that women's progress is ongoing and only gets better if we actually THINK about changing it. This class rocked!"
12,2.5,2.0, WMSTD110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"The lectures were very interesting and always well prepared.She tried to have everyone participate in class! Too bad she never talk about the reading in class. The TA makes the class. I had a bad one, Meghan Kough who only cared about applying for her PhD program. The TA makes the meat out of the class, all the fun debates! Overall, good class!"
13,2.5,3.0, WMSTD110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,Very enthusiastic and passionate. I found the mandatory attendance annoying. But overall lessons were okay. 5 writing assignments a must. Midterms & Finals were not comprehensive. Always go for the pre-exam review sessions. Good class if you are interested in Women Studies or Gender studies.
14,3.5,1.0, WOMST110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"Easy class...lots of work for a 110 course, though.  Dr. Smooth is pretty funny and has entertaining lectures, she also enjoys pop quizzes. A ton of reading and 5 mandatory papers. Good class, so long as you have an interest in womens studies"
15,3.0,3.0, WOMST110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,Lectures were very long and did not always stay on point.It helps to have a good TA because I found that my notes from lecture weren't all that helpful on the midterm.
16,1.5,3.0, WS110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"I had a horrible experience in this class. It was uncomfortable to speak in class and there was too much work for a 100 level class. She ignored any emails sent to her and so was not helpful at all. She also passed out an ""Etiquette Sheet"" saying we were not welcome to visit her in her office, and that we shouldn't ask questions about the tests."
17,5.0,5.0, WN513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"Dr. Smooth is an excellent and very professional instructor.  She knows her material very well. She backs up her statements with facts and interesting anecdotes.  She requires you to work hard, but it certainly pays.  This class brought out the best in me, writing skills, ability to analyse and she is extremely well organised.  Not for slackers!"
18,2.5,4.0, WMNST110,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"Not worth it to take as a 100 level teacher.  Enthusiastic about material, not in making work load appropriate for a 100 level class.  Too much outside reading required, mandatory attendance in lecture and recitation, 5 papers plus final and midterm.  Material v. interesting, it just took way too much work to get an A."
19,1.5,5.0, PS513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"I agree with the other poster. This class was not enjoyable.  There were three books, the readings were long and boring. Lecture was the same - long, boring and mandatory.  Detailed questions about readings on tests. Going into the final we only knew 30% of our grade... which was the overly difficult mid-term. I would not recommend this Class."
20,1.0,4.0, WOMST513,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,WENDY,SMOOTH,"While it was obvious Dr. Smooth enjoyed what she was teaching and encouraged debates, she was the most unhelpful professor when it came to outside of the classroom.  I tried to contact her numerous times and she totally ignored me, along with her TA Stacia Kock.  She talked the ENTIRE class and the readings took forever! DONT TAKE HER CLASS!"
